﻿1
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:13,153
Inspector, we found the property.

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,060
You have to scour every single corner of this house.

3
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,129
All the plan, fuck.

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,378
Hours, photos, programs.

5
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:23,534
It makes no sense. Call Alberto ...

6
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:26,032
Is not it the best of the scientific? So, come on.

7
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:28,197
All they wanted to eliminate seriously ...

8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,982
they will have burned him in here.

9
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,282
I take this to the central of Canillas.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,401
I really had to go to Madrid, I would have taken the bus.

11
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:38,425
I was thinking back to what you said before ...

12
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:40,279
to the fact that you wish the best of Raquel.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,029
If so, you do not ...

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,078
he discovered his sister.

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,251
- Piece of shit. - Get out of the car.

16
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,999
Son of a bitch.

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,747
You are under arrest for assault on a public official.

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,901
Give me the revolver.

19
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,481
Tell us about the Chernobil plan.

20
00:01:11,932 --> 00:01:14,329
I'm the only one in here who knows the plan.

21
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,212
You will not have the slightest idea how to get out of this fucking trap.

22
00:01:26,182 --> 00:01:28,530
Listen to me, it could not be the beginning ...

23
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:30,900
of a wonderful friendship?

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,951
Take off your boots and tracksuit, fast!

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,200
Do not shoot.

26
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,500
Tokyo.

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,479
- Fuck. - Rio ...

28
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,450
- you must calm down. - No, you sent Tokyo to jail.

29
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:53,680
She's my girlfriend and you ruined her life.

30
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:56,629
Perhaps you do not realize why you are here against your will, Mónica ...

31
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,830
but you have a syndrome.

32
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:59,430
- What syndrome? - Of Stockholm.

33
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:01,629
Speech closed. You continue on your way ...

34
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,700
I for mine, without looking back.

35
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:06,129
The Professor, Berlin, is not there!

36
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,429
There is only you. And he is the brain.

37
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,629
This is a patriarchy.

38
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,751
- And what would you like to say? - It means that I command here.

39
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,997
I can go to the bathroom?

40
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,200
I call you from the police station, they arrested me.

41
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,951
I tell you that I'm attending one and two seconds time are you fighting?

42
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,929
- I have not done anything. - No?

43
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,951
Come with me.

44
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:34,129
I do not know how the fuck is done but I swear I did not touch it.

45
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,551
Remove the cuffs.

46
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,479
I'm happy to see you again, Miss Tokio.

47
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,080
I ask and she answers.

48
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:41,399
Who is the Professor?

49
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:43,228
Very good, you have chosen.

50
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,930
Bad, but you have chosen.

51
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,051
Take it away.

52
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:48,282
Sergio!

53
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,604
The Professor is called Sergio Marquina.

54
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:52,015
And the blow is an idea of ​​his father.

55
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:53,915
And the person who helps you from the outside, who is he?

56
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,830
<i> Inspector, I just called to say hello ... </ i>

57
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:58,380
<i> let me interrogate Tokio. </ i>

58
00:02:58,381 --> 00:02:59,830
That from here I do not move.

59
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:02,680
- What is it you have to tell me? - Inside, we have a hydrogen bomb ...

60
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:03,980
of seventeen megatons.

61
00:03:03,981 --> 00:03:07,028
We will propose detention in isolation.

62
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:08,270
Lobo, take it away.

63
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,729
It was a very bad idea to talk to the hostages, Rio.

64
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,146
You can even throw me out like Tokyo.

65
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,476
You are guilty of high treason, Rio.

66
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,579
- What will you do to me? - Execute yourself.

67
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,250
Lower the gun.

68
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,250
<i> Control call. </ i>

69
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,000
Here, everything is as smooth as oil.

70
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,101
<i> Like oil? </ i>

71
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,950
Like oil, do you mean Tokyo interrogated by the police?

72
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,427
Like oil, you mean that for a while ...

73
00:03:42,428 --> 00:03:43,630
did not you do Rio?

74
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:45,250
<i> Berlin, what are you doing? </ i>

75
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,551
Professor, I'm Nairobi.

76
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,379
Berlin is not doing very well ...

77
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,000
so, starting now, I'm in charge.

78
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:00,751
The matriarchy begins.

79
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:08,029
If we took a picture now ...

80
00:04:08,046 --> 00:04:11,199
it could be my last memory of the State Mint.

81
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,199
In there I left a series of errors ...

82
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,851
a band in pieces ...

83
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:19,848
and only one kidnapper with balls to load everything on his shoulder ...

84
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:21,025
Nairobi.

85
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,651
What I mean, Professor, and that's a mess here.

86
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:27,500
<i> The measure has been lost inside. </ i>

87
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:32,351
Tokio played Russian roulette with Berlin tied to a chair.

88
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,250
And Berlin handed it to the police.

89
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,179
So Rio defected,

90
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,950
and Berlin almost did not shoot her in Vietnam style, fuck.

91
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,549
And then Helsinki suffocated Oslo.

92
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,351
Did he kill him?

93
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:54,722
<i> It was a vegetable, now ... </ i>

94
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,279
<i> according to Helsinki, that's what he wanted. </ i>

95
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,650
<i> As you can see, Professor, everything went to hell here. </ i>

96
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,997
So

97
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:06,013
I have to take the reins in my hands until the waters have calmed down.

98
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:08,251
Ask him what the fuck was he doing with the police?

99
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:11,421
I was in the house of Toledo because it was part of the plan.

100
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,998
<I> Professor ... </ i>

101
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,399
here we need to know what situation we are in.

102
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
MONDAY 9:00 PM

103
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,700
There are some problems, I'll be honest.

104
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,280
83 HOURS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE RAPINA

105
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,949
I would call it the biggest "problemino" in history.

106
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,967
Deputy Inspector Ángel had discovered the identity of the Professor.

107
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,944
He had isolated his fingerprints.

108
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,635
At the moment he was in a coma, but he would have told it as soon as he was awake.

109
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:36,449
The Professor had the days counted.

110
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,657
And with him, also all the others.

111
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,850
And the situation there is not better, from what you tell me.

112
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:49,999
Listen ...

113
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:53,850
do what you owe out there, <i> </ i> in the meantime I'll fix things in here.

114
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,242
And now I'll give you the call that is definitely the inspector.

115
00:06:03,181 --> 00:06:04,300
Inspector.

116
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,080
Before returning to us, I would like to take a doubt ...

117
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:10,151
<i> from now on as you want me to call you ... </ i>

118
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,699
<I> Professor ... </ i>

119
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,650
<i> Sergio, or ... </ i>

120
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,900
<i> Mr. Marquina? </ i>

121
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,199
For her I will always be the Professor.

122
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,508
That's how we met, right?

123
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:23,029
<i> I will always remember her as Inspector Murillo. </ i>

124
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,251
<i> Even if one day he became my executioner. </ i>

125
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:30,362
Remember the first time he made love?

126
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,300
Of course, that never forgets, no?

127
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,400
Well, this is my first time ...

128
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:40,851
in the world of crime.

129
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,599
And in any way it will go, it will be forever ...

130
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,901
a nice memory.

131
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,100
<i> You are passionate ... </ i>

132
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,813
and this world needs people like her.

133
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:56,228
I hope when he gets out of prison fully rehabilitated ...

134
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:58,889
<i> is dedicated to waking up this country because the truth is that ... </ i>

135
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:00,798
<i> Where was it? </ i>

136
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:02,483
Don't ask why!

137
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,700
His first time.

138
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:10,445
In a field tent.

139
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,950
<i> How nice. </ i>

140
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,599
That's a nice place for a first time.

141
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:17,700
The murmur of the countryside, the light ...

142
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,850
Yes, that yes ...

143
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:22,451
while the rest, let's say ...

144
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:25,230
he was improvised ...

145
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:26,231
E {0}01.01.2016{/0}

146
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,451
no frills.

147
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:29,950
Well, Professor ...

148
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:34,128
I called her to inform her that her accomplice, Silene Oliveira,

149
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,075
<i> from tonight ... </ i>

150
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,851
<i> will be under precautionary custody without the possibility of bail, from tonight. </ i>

151
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,428
What did he say to make her angry so much that he did not take advantage of the 72 hours of detention?

152
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,377
He did a little too gorgeous.

153
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,679
But one thing I do not understand ...

154
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,112
<i> why get out ... </ i>

155
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,250
<i> a robber rather than a hostage? </ i>

156
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:53,679
Let's say that misunderstandings have arisen in the group, nothing more.

157
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,601
We put you on the ropes, Professor.

158
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,029
- <i> And you know it. </ i> - It's true, it's the advantage, inspector ...

159
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,480
but this is just a battle ...

160
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:01,849
<i> something insignificant if you compare it to war. </ i>

161
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,221
Keep teasing her despite the mutiny.

162
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,250
Is good.

163
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,082
<I> Save ... </ i>

164
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,851
<i> how are you? </ i>

165
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,843
Are your bruises still bad?

166
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,081
Well!

167
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,870
I never imagined that lacing my shoes could do so badly.

168
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,864
It is clear that those bruises need treatment ...

169
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:48,300
<i> of a nurse. </ i>

170
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,650
It's

171
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,051
very tempting proposal.

172
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,401
I'd really like to take care of you, but ...

173
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:00,729
we should meet with me, because I want to see my daughter, and ...

174
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,050
<i> I know it's not the most romantic plan in the world. </ i>

175
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,410
I could not imagine a better plan for tonight.

176
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
okay.

177
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:17,511
When you spend years thinking obsessively about something ...

178
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,099
that something becomes your world.

179
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,750
A perfect world.

180
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,560
But now the plan was no longer just the Professor ...

181
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,901
it was everyone's.

182
00:09:26,505 --> 00:09:28,566
And we were sending him all a bit to hell.

183
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:38,707
The Professor felt unarmed, for once ...

184
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,932
and burrowing himself in Raquel's arms seemed to him the best refuge ...

185
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,233
the only possible.

186
00:09:55,615 --> 00:09:57,280
Now you're a hostage too.

187
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:09,618
What happened to you?

188
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:13,886
They tried to kill me ...

189
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:16,686
they almost shot me.

190
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:19,260
Why did they want to kill you?

191
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:22,635
They gave Tokyo to the police ...

192
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:26,448
and I wanted to deliver myself too.

193
00:10:31,573 --> 00:10:34,302
- Alison. - Leave it, let it.

194
00:10:35,273 --> 00:10:37,301
- Let her. - That girl has lost her mind ...

195
00:10:37,402 --> 00:10:42,022
- if Tokio arrived, who knows what he would do to her. - You will not come, you heard, they kicked her out.

196
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:46,557
What Alison is doing can make us comfortable.

197
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:49,131
- Make us comfortable for what? - To get out of here, fuck ...

198
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,831
once and for all.

199
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:54,015
Fucking, is it so hard to understand?

200
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:57,861
They locked up our comrades ...

201
00:10:58,056 --> 00:11:00,216
when they had promised him freedom.

202
00:11:01,688 --> 00:11:04,838
Some of us have been deeply humiliated.

203
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,748
They ruined my relationship ...

204
00:11:08,677 --> 00:11:10,226
and my future fatherhood.

205
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:14,880
And as for the money that they promised us to stay in this hell ...

206
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:18,791
It's all a lie.

207
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:21,581
A fucking farce.

208
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:23,397
He confirmed it.

209
00:11:24,855 --> 00:11:27,527
Until when do we want to stay with our hands in our hands?

210
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,443
The robbers are now in trouble ...

211
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:32,811
it is indisputable ...

212
00:11:32,812 --> 00:11:35,062
and do not take advantage of this opportunity right away ...

213
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:36,710
means to let them escape.

214
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:38,658
We must give him the coup de grace.

215
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:41,149
Recover your dignity, fuck, courage,

216
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,838
this wild beast that we keep hidden and ...

217
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:45,589
Yes, we have to do something ...

218
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,640
□ I don't know

219
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:48,464
steal a weapon from him.

220
00:11:49,204 --> 00:11:51,378
As? What do you say, Arturo?

221
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:53,128
Where do we find a gun?

222
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,868
Replacing it with a fake.

223
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:01,413
If you can get one of the fake guns ...

224
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:03,510
you can exchange it.

225
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:07,273
So one of them will be disarmed ...

226
00:12:08,568 --> 00:12:10,101
and one of you, armed.

227
00:12:14,394 --> 00:12:17,394


228
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:20,395
The house de papel - 1x12 Cuestión de eficacia

229
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:26,789


230
00:12:28,924 --> 00:12:30,924


231
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:12,238


232
00:13:15,716 --> 00:13:17,166
Hey, hi, honey.

233
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:19,857
- Mom, what are you doing here so late? - Mom.

234
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:22,435
Honey, come here.

235
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:23,669
It's fine

236
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:28,737
But then, you ...

237
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:32,226
- What are you doing here so late? - I did not want to go to bed without saying goodbye.

238
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:33,458
Neither me, my life.

239
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,000
Bye.

240
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:42,367
Bye.

241
00:13:42,391 --> 00:13:45,273
But why did not you warn? I would have prepared dinner for you.

242
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,645
You came to have dinner, right?

243
00:13:47,862 --> 00:13:51,134
Yes, well, to have dinner and even to sleep ...

244
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:52,219
don't you?

245
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,356
Are you coming out together?

246
00:13:59,617 --> 00:14:00,617
Well!

247
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,053
Yes No?

248
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:05,273
More or less.

249
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:07,871
But did you ask her?

250
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:11,106
Well, no, actually not, but ...

251
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:14,030
but we kissed, that's ...

252
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:15,252
almost the same thing.

253
00:14:15,848 --> 00:14:18,819
- All right. - Come on, Paulita, honey, let's go ...

254
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:20,651
Let's go, you'll have school tomorrow.

255
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:22,941
Let's go to bed. No, stay there ...

256
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:24,062
I put her in bed.

257
00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:41,393
Thank you.

258
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:50,529
Is it true that you beat him?

259
00:14:56,374 --> 00:14:57,374
Well!

260
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:01,006
Well ... yes.

261
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:05,754
It is that blood boiled at the thought that he had put his hands on you.

262
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,760
I do not like violence, I do not ...

263
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:13,292
never liked it. I know you should not use it and that you know how to defend yourself very well from you ...

264
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:15,672
- and I do not have the right to put myself ... - Save.

265
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:21,166
I'm glad you gave slaps to that wretch of my ex ...

266
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,502
I should have done it.

267
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:26,180
Although it is politically incorrect to say so.

268
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Well!

269
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:36,520
sometimes the politically incorrect is ...

270
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:37,939
the only option.

271
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,574
I tell you from experience.

272
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:50,487
I'm glad you're here.

273
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:44,698
Well, from now on you have to take care of closing the bags ...

274
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,241
- tirelessly. - Lies says nothing.

275
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:50,546
Arturito is not the time to make Gandhi, because you would receive punches for breakfast,

276
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:52,489
lunch and dinner.

277
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:55,246
Plus I can assure you ...

278
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,028
that I have not lied to anyone.

279
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:05,912
In command now there is Nairobi ...

280
00:17:05,913 --> 00:17:08,162
so get everyone to close the bags.

281
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,516
Nairobi has a wrist to be a woman.

282
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,839
Berlin...

283
00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:22,716
we are going to peak.

284
00:17:23,197 --> 00:17:25,807
So I think the most important thing now ...

285
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:28,209
both come out alive from here ...

286
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:30,252
without making other mistakes.

287
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,253
You decide...

288
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,904
you are with me...

289
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:40,753
or against me?

290
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:44,947
A bi bo ...

291
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:46,631
who's underneath I do not know ...

292
00:17:47,343 --> 00:17:50,708
- but I will soon know it. - but I will soon know it.

293
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:58,717
All right, Nairobi, I'll follow you ...

294
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:00,451
till death.

295
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:03,918
I will respect your coup ...

296
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,451
and I must confess that I even feel excited ...

297
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:10,704
the idea of ​​serving a woman who seems so divine.

298
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:12,980
Well, you'd better venerate this goddess ...

299
00:18:13,214 --> 00:18:15,365
because he has your morphine, do not forget it.

300
00:18:18,113 --> 00:18:21,066
That's the office where fake guns hide.

301
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,724
- IS? - One of us must go there ...

302
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:26,180
and take up arms.

303
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,968
And which robber do you think you care about the real one?

304
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:32,707
In Denver.

305
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,165
It is the most stupid.

306
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:39,607
- And who will take the gun? - Mónica will have to do it,

307
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:43,582
- taking advantage of when the gauze changes. - And why should he do something like that?

308
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,645
It's suicide.

309
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:49,142
Because that bullet shot her ...

310
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:55,146
he locked her in a hole and took advantage of her fear and despair ...

311
00:18:56,188 --> 00:18:57,980
to get fucked.

312
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:03,128
And it seems that now he left her, right?

313
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:07,068
Yes.

314
00:19:09,254 --> 00:19:10,350
I'm sorry.

315
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,928
But it went like this.

316
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:17,766
Sometimes we would like to change life ...

317
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:19,700
we make illusions ...

318
00:19:21,563 --> 00:19:23,756
but no robber will ever take you away with him.

319
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,420
Alright then.

320
00:19:29,424 --> 00:19:30,957
I'll take care of the gun.

321
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:34,654
Do you have copies of the office keys?

322
00:19:38,942 --> 00:19:40,739
What is the Chernobil plan?

323
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,404
The Chernobil plan is a plan ...

324
00:19:43,753 --> 00:19:45,649
desperate, but very cute ...

325
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,051
it consisted of throwing the banknotes from the roof with balloons ...

326
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,291
and blow up the balloons with the guns causing a wonderful rain,

327
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:57,620
- then call media, radio, television ... - It would be like the parade of the Magi Kings ...

328
00:19:57,621 --> 00:19:59,385
but with 50-dollar bills.

329
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:01,668
Is this the Chernobil plan?

330
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:06,022
Thousands of people gathering the grain, the most total chaos in the police, imagine ...

331
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:09,232
- 1000 million euros falling from the sky. - Yeah ...

332
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:12,199
while we run away in the hubbub.

333
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:15,311
Very nice.

334
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:17,749
You know that the Professor is an idealist ...

335
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:20,853
the message matters more than money.

336
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:24,747
And I have not told you anything because you have to respect the times.

337
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,752
Give me good luck.

338
00:20:57,641 --> 00:20:59,339
Mr. Torres ...

339
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:01,348
At my office.

340
00:21:20,664 --> 00:21:21,883
Come on, Mr. Torres.

341
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:23,711
So,

342
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:26,540
could we increase the printing rhythm?

343
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:28,026
So,

344
00:21:28,027 --> 00:21:29,461
for power, we could ...

345
00:21:29,644 --> 00:21:31,485
but we would take a big risk ...

346
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:33,273
if it gets jammed ...

347
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:36,111
it would take three or four hours to fix the car.

348
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:39,566
Calculations of how much we would increase production.

349
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,067
All right, Miss Nairobi.

350
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:04,879
Don Arturo?

351
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:07,350
Get up.

352
00:22:07,351 --> 00:22:09,611
Get up, Torres, fuck, get up.

353
00:22:09,902 --> 00:22:12,129
- What are you doing there? - It's not your business.

354
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,927
Listen to me, pretend nothing ...

355
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:16,040
go straight to the door and do not close it from outside.

356
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:18,869
I'm sorry, but I'll have to say about her.

357
00:22:19,112 --> 00:22:22,124
If they find out I've seen it, it will be trouble for me too.

358
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,384
Listen

359
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:24,837
puppet subspecies ...

360
00:22:25,952 --> 00:22:27,097
I have a gun.

361
00:22:27,853 --> 00:22:29,600
If you dare to do the spy ...

362
00:22:29,744 --> 00:22:31,616
the first bullet is all yours, understand?

363
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:34,857
Excuse me, Don Arturo, but that gun is fake ...

364
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,094
he also left the bag open.

365
00:22:41,712 --> 00:22:42,857
Listen to me...

366
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:45,241
listen to me well because I will not say it twice.

367
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:47,059
When it's all over ...

368
00:22:47,063 --> 00:22:49,531
and I assure you that, at most, they remain just two hours ...

369
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:50,744
you will come back here ...

370
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:53,465
at your shit job.

371
00:22:54,961 --> 00:22:57,419
And the next day you will find me waiting for you ...

372
00:22:57,747 --> 00:22:59,526
with a letter of dismissal ...

373
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,223
and a disciplinary procedure that you do not even imagine.

374
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:04,313
You will see the green mice up to retirement ...

375
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:05,616
Do you understand? ...

376
00:23:06,568 --> 00:23:08,359
If I'm not mistaken you have three daughters, right?

377
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:12,001
And two of them are unemployed from around ...

378
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:14,792
seven years? If memory does not deceive me.

379
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:17,265
So you decide ...

380
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,564
Torres.

381
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:23,186
- Miss Nairobi. - Tell me.

382
00:23:25,673 --> 00:23:30,191
Productivity would increase by two million per hour.

383
00:23:31,641 --> 00:23:32,643
Just do it.

384
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,783
And what's more ...

385
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:36,215
we will do the technical stops every six hours ...

386
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:38,845
- so will be another two million more. - Agree.

387
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:45,664
Of this I am sure, as it is true that my name is Nairobi.

388
00:24:30,237 --> 00:24:31,988
Is there something that worries you?

389
00:24:35,231 --> 00:24:36,231
No

390
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,828
No, it worries me that it was the best night of my life.

391
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:51,529
Save

392
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,630
you already have me in hand, you do not need to exaggerate.

393
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:56,787
It's true.

394
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,414
The fact is that I had not foreseen it, I had not calculated it.

395
00:25:03,722 --> 00:25:05,386
You did not calculate it.

396
00:25:06,162 --> 00:25:08,371
And what does it mean, what do you calculate everything?

397
00:25:15,378 --> 00:25:17,002
Well, let's say ...

398
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,207
that I am a man who ...

399
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:27,792
choose the clothes to wear the day before.

400
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:34,135
A man who has fixed himself ...

401
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,460
with the idea ...

402
00:25:38,112 --> 00:25:40,229
to make the best cider in the world.

403
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,940
and right now... you are?

404
00:25:42,452 --> 00:25:44,471
and I studied everything, I studied ...

405
00:25:45,217 --> 00:25:48,160
acidity, fermentation ...

406
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,136
every possible answer of each ingredient.

407
00:25:55,229 --> 00:25:56,442
Year...

408
00:25:57,405 --> 00:25:59,363
after year, after year.

409
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:03,055
And just that an apple is not good ...

410
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,044
to ruin the whole barrel.

411
00:26:08,168 --> 00:26:10,682
Save, maybe you've exaggerated with cider, do not you think?

412
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,672
It was a dream that my father had.

413
00:26:16,762 --> 00:26:17,762
But...

414
00:26:20,084 --> 00:26:21,836
he died before he realized it.

415
00:26:24,588 --> 00:26:25,588
carefully.

416
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,822
he wanted to do ...

417
00:26:30,585 --> 00:26:32,617
2,400 barrels.

418
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,745
I understand the tribute to the memory, but ...

419
00:26:37,225 --> 00:26:38,846
I do not know, why do not you make half of it?

420
00:26:39,496 --> 00:26:41,309
Or half of the half, and ...

421
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:43,096
And than...

422
00:26:43,931 --> 00:26:45,977
you dedicate yourself to your dreams.

423
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,891
Let's leave.

424
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:08,079
I solve this cider thing in a few days and ...

425
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,608
and you and I leave you in a Caribbean country.

426
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:20,374
Well!

427
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:21,851
IO-01

428
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:24,100
I do not have cider to do, but ...

429
00:27:24,753 --> 00:27:27,564
but I have a mother and a daughter and ...

430
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:31,486
- and a robbery to end. - So let's take your mother ...

431
00:27:32,112 --> 00:27:34,121
and your daughter and we bring them with us.

432
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:35,463
You can not see your daughter ...

433
00:27:35,685 --> 00:27:37,493
to grow on a beach under the sun?

434
00:27:41,358 --> 00:27:42,358
Raquel.

435
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,412
Raquel, I do not want it to end.

436
00:27:47,985 --> 00:27:49,906
I do not want to ignore this ...

437
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:54,970
this desire that I feel alive, because I've never had so much.

438
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:06,313
You would cross the ocean with ...

439
00:28:06,757 --> 00:28:08,095
with a mother ...

440
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:09,469
a daughter and ...

441
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,082
a grandmother?

442
00:28:12,588 --> 00:28:14,032
Right now, yes.

443
00:28:17,587 --> 00:28:19,136
It's a plan B.

444
00:28:27,381 --> 00:28:28,634
It is that it is ...

445
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:31,396
so crazy that ...

446
00:28:32,637 --> 00:28:33,637
that

447
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:37,510
that I do not see myself doing anything else.

448
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:51,567
Close the robbery speech, do what you have to do.

449
00:28:54,345 --> 00:28:55,888
And then we leave.

450
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,405
Okay, okay.

451
00:29:08,406 --> 00:29:09,762
Okay, okay.

452
00:29:09,788 --> 00:29:10,788
Yes.

453
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:35,103
Listen to me all ...

454
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:37,905
we will end this robbery in 24 hours ...

455
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:40,884
and we will return to our lives, which we have already neglected enough.

456
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,322
Suárez ...

457
00:29:42,368 --> 00:29:43,743
he calls Commissioner Sánchez.

458
00:29:43,744 --> 00:29:45,510
I will not let anyone else die ...

459
00:29:45,511 --> 00:29:48,359
neither that you destroy from within nor that you capture. So, Nairobi ...

460
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:51,480
listen to me, the fact that you have arrived here is already something epic ...

461
00:29:51,481 --> 00:29:54,177
so I'll give you my most sincere congratulations.

462
00:29:54,258 --> 00:29:55,536
<i> Listen to me well ... </ i>

463
00:29:55,956 --> 00:29:57,524
<i> I will get you out of there ... </ i>

464
00:29:58,148 --> 00:29:59,964
before they get you out.

465
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,073
Also bring Lobo and others from the Central Operations Service.

466
00:30:02,074 --> 00:30:04,951
- What are you thinking, inspector? - I start thinking ...

467
00:30:04,952 --> 00:30:08,502
that the man who is outside is the real brain of the operation.

468
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:12,832
It is he who has filled the way with clues to take us to the estate of Toledo ...

469
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,621
but I think I know how to take it.

470
00:30:14,622 --> 00:30:17,241
The first thing we will do is get the hostages out of the basement.

471
00:30:17,242 --> 00:30:20,880
Well, thank you, because we do not have so many people to control the hostages.

472
00:30:21,348 --> 00:30:23,270
And then we promised him freedom, right?

473
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:24,655
That they have freedom, then.

474
00:30:24,716 --> 00:30:27,571
We will free those hostages, but give me an hour.

475
00:30:28,212 --> 00:30:31,147
It's too big a show for such a small audience.

476
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:47,195
- Hello?

477
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:49,202
I will free 11 hostages.

478
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:51,541
<i> But on one condition ... </ i>

479
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,718
I want a journalist and a cameraman to come in ...

480
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:56,621
to cover the news from the inside, a direct link.

481
00:30:57,786 --> 00:30:58,786
Look ...

482
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:01,283
I'd like to help her with her propaganda, but ...

483
00:31:01,352 --> 00:31:04,039
I can not force any civilian to go in there ...

484
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,158
- <i> he knows this well. </ i> - It's true.

485
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,987
He is completely right, inspector.

486
00:31:08,988 --> 00:31:12,631
But she does not have to force anyone, she just has to propose it.

487
00:31:12,632 --> 00:31:15,671
I'm sure there will be many journalists ...

488
00:31:15,672 --> 00:31:18,013
<i> volunteers for an interview like this. </ i>

489
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:22,119
- I have to think about it. - Of course, think about it.

490
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:26,547
But remember that I record these conversations and the last time ...

491
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:29,120
<i> who refused to free the hostages ... </ i>

492
00:31:29,923 --> 00:31:33,440
<i> let's say he did not make a big impression with public opinion. </ i>

493
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:35,879
Anyway, of course, take your time.

494
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,831
What a son of a bitch.

495
00:31:42,147 --> 00:31:43,171
God.

496
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,808
Well, let's talk about something else. As I can explain it, let's see ...

497
00:31:54,284 --> 00:31:55,447
Do you like football?

498
00:31:56,477 --> 00:31:59,120
Football, Professor. In what world do you think ...

499
00:31:59,976 --> 00:32:01,524
Well, then imagine ...

500
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:03,950
- a soccer match. - Still with football?

501
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:06,911
No, no, Nairobi, listen. A World Cup football match ...

502
00:32:07,478 --> 00:32:10,450
and they are playing Brazil and Cameroon.

503
00:32:10,505 --> 00:32:11,981
- Who win? - Well ...

504
00:32:11,982 --> 00:32:13,736
Sorry, I express myself better ...

505
00:32:13,887 --> 00:32:16,045
who do you want to win?

506
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:17,869
To win, Brazil wins.

507
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:20,798
But I would support for Cameroon, for sure.

508
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:22,349
- Cameroon. - Yup.

509
00:32:22,477 --> 00:32:24,543
- Cameroon, Cameroon. - Cameroon or death.

510
00:32:24,544 --> 00:32:26,070
If you notice ...

511
00:32:26,796 --> 00:32:29,527
instinctively human being ...

512
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:31,830
always puts on the side ...

513
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:33,270
of the weakest ...

514
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,948
of losers.

515
00:32:35,695 --> 00:32:39,609
So if we show the world our weaknesses, our ...

516
00:32:40,018 --> 00:32:41,200
wounds ...

517
00:32:41,525 --> 00:32:43,183
that we are on the point ...

518
00:32:43,616 --> 00:32:44,887
to surrender ...

519
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:46,760
we will produce a ...

520
00:32:47,858 --> 00:32:49,258
emotion.

521
00:32:49,357 --> 00:32:52,990
Apart from the Brazilians, I think anyone would cheer Cameroon.

522
00:32:52,991 --> 00:32:54,981
Even some Brazilian.

523
00:32:54,982 --> 00:32:57,161
- Or Brazilian. - Or Brazilian.

524
00:32:57,162 --> 00:32:59,185
Gentlemen, strength, force Cameroon then, no?

525
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:01,349
How's that song you sing at games?

526
00:33:01,498 --> 00:33:04,592
Cameroon, Cameroon, Cameroon.

527
00:33:04,645 --> 00:33:07,789
Cameroon, Cameroon, Cameroon.

528
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,078
Cameroon, Cameroon, Cameroon.

529
00:33:11,131 --> 00:33:12,621
Cameroon ...

530
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:14,686
Cameroon!

531
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,178
Let's move on to the Cameroon floor.

532
00:33:17,189 --> 00:33:19,884
We will free the hostages who are in the basement ...

533
00:33:19,885 --> 00:33:23,999
and a journalist and a cameraman will come back to the scene.

534
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,292
We will need someone to do the interview.

535
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:29,538
And my choice ...

536
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:31,427
it's you, Rio.

537
00:33:32,934 --> 00:33:35,810
I understand you're pissed off, but we need you.

538
00:33:35,811 --> 00:33:37,674
You can do it without a mask ...

539
00:33:37,675 --> 00:33:38,894
You're nice...

540
00:33:38,895 --> 00:33:40,652
Do you really think I want to end up on TV?

541
00:33:41,825 --> 00:33:43,744
So does Tokio see me from prison?

542
00:33:43,752 --> 00:33:45,731
With a toothy smile ...

543
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,982
while they interview me as if a fuck did not happen here?

544
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,392
I'm a hostage now, right?

545
00:33:51,497 --> 00:33:53,242
Do not count on me.

546
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:00,575
Fuck it, I'll do it.

547
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,955
I have a poor loser's face, I've always had it.

548
00:34:02,956 --> 00:34:04,331
You do not have a loser face ...

549
00:34:04,332 --> 00:34:05,916
you have the face to wear.

550
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,542
I'll do it.

551
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:11,521
If you do not have to talk a lot.

552
00:34:11,608 --> 00:34:12,682
I'll do it.

553
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,575
It's an idea. It's an idea.

554
00:34:15,576 --> 00:34:17,090
But no, no.

555
00:34:18,184 --> 00:34:19,892
I'll do it, with the mask.

556
00:34:25,406 --> 00:34:26,621
With the mask.

557
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:29,718
A live interview?

558
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:32,438
What we are?

559
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:33,624
ETA?

560
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:36,770
Jihadists?

561
00:34:36,984 --> 00:34:38,198
No, no, no.

562
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:41,676
This interview must be done ...

563
00:34:41,892 --> 00:34:43,441
with the face uncovered.

564
00:34:43,442 --> 00:34:45,519
So that all of Spain ...

565
00:34:45,621 --> 00:34:48,148
can perceive our looks ...

566
00:34:49,186 --> 00:34:51,158
our breath ...

567
00:34:51,193 --> 00:34:53,051
that can perceive pain.

568
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:55,685
And even a little 'suffering.

569
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,771
Yeah

570
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,010
In short, do you want to do it?

571
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:04,204
Is that...

572
00:35:04,617 --> 00:35:05,789
You know what?

573
00:35:06,442 --> 00:35:10,265
If there is a person I have never seen, try neither suffering nor pain ...

574
00:35:10,266 --> 00:35:11,382
that one is you.

575
00:35:11,383 --> 00:35:12,458
Berlin.

576
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:14,623
Tokyo is not there.

577
00:35:15,044 --> 00:35:16,470
And Rio does not want to do it.

578
00:35:17,209 --> 00:35:20,474
Do not despise those who can do their job well, Nairobi.

579
00:35:21,555 --> 00:35:23,790
I can be a perfect master of ceremonies.

580
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:24,941
He is right.

581
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:27,202
He knows how to act very well.

582
00:35:31,582 --> 00:35:32,709
very good

583
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:35,170
You will do it.

584
00:35:39,863 --> 00:35:43,693
A live interview in exchange for the release of eleven hostages.

585
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,920
It's more...

586
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:46,361
justifiable, no?

587
00:35:46,543 --> 00:35:48,530
They will cut us apart.

588
00:35:48,684 --> 00:35:50,338
But we can only accept.

589
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:52,547
We try to turn the thing to our advantage ...

590
00:35:52,548 --> 00:35:54,835
presenting it as a transparency operation.

591
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:56,874
You can sell it as you wish, Prieto.

592
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,081
But the other thing?

593
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:02,130
The operation you want to organize at the hospital?

594
00:36:02,448 --> 00:36:04,541
In exchange for what, based on what, Raquel?

595
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:05,860
Of a plate of anchovies?

596
00:36:05,861 --> 00:36:08,582
Based on the fact that the robbers have an external aide ...

597
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,259
that puts us the sticks in the wheels.

598
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,251
Ángel knows who he is ...

599
00:36:11,262 --> 00:36:13,339
- and they almost killed him, other than an accident. - Provincial.

600
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,887
Here we have read the scientific report on the Ángel incident ...

601
00:36:16,983 --> 00:36:19,812
and there is no evidence that it was attempted murder.

602
00:36:19,813 --> 00:36:22,966
Let's not forget that he drove in a state of intoxication.

603
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:23,979
Alright...

604
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,265
Do you want some tests?

605
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,720
We organize the operation.

606
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:29,235
Let me leap to the press that Ángel ...

607
00:36:29,236 --> 00:36:30,818
the only person who knows who he is ...

608
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:32,335
he will wake up from the coma.

609
00:36:32,378 --> 00:36:35,170
And I assure you that by five in the afternoon ...

610
00:36:35,303 --> 00:36:38,176
that man will be in the hospital to kill him.

611
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:41,179
But we will be there too, to capture him like a cat and a mouse.

612
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,022
You're asking me to fill a hospital ...

613
00:36:44,197 --> 00:36:46,167
of undercover agents, in style ...

614
00:36:46,254 --> 00:36:47,609
Mortadello and Polpetta.

615
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,480
We should concentrate our resources here on the mint.

616
00:36:50,638 --> 00:36:52,685
Have you thought about the journalists we'll let in?

617
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,149
And if they took them hostage?

618
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,368
The interview is just a smoke screen.

619
00:36:56,369 --> 00:36:58,600
Another trick to make us waste time.

620
00:36:59,606 --> 00:37:00,724
- Inspector.

621
00:37:00,996 --> 00:37:02,378
let me for once ...

622
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:05,285
we are trying to set a trap.

623
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,694
Are ten men enough?

624
00:37:10,933 --> 00:37:12,025
Twenty.

625
00:37:21,454 --> 00:37:23,530
Monica Gaztambide, it's time for treatment.

626
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:33,807
Come on.

627
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:06,519
If you take off your suit, I can cure you.

628
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:10,733
Can you turn around?

629
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:14,245
We're not together anymore, are we?

630
00:38:17,288 --> 00:38:18,661
No problem.

631
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:55,164
May I?

632
00:38:55,506 --> 00:38:56,598
Wait!

633
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:00,974
1 hour

634
00:39:21,681 --> 00:39:23,028
How's the wound?

635
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:25,377
It hurts me very much.

636
00:39:26,911 --> 00:39:28,078
And it burns me.

637
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:41,530
We will only have one chance.

638
00:39:41,531 --> 00:39:42,834
I want it alive.

639
00:39:43,237 --> 00:39:46,555
Nobody pulls the trigger, except in extreme cases.

640
00:39:47,277 --> 00:39:49,134
The first thing we will do ...

641
00:39:49,265 --> 00:39:52,339
it will take Ángel away and put it in a safe place.

642
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,729
For this reason

643
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:56,324
we will have to prepare another room on another floor.

644
00:39:57,582 --> 00:40:01,086
Once it is safe, we will leak the news of his recovery.

645
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:03,520
And the goal will not be slow to get going.

646
00:40:03,906 --> 00:40:06,661
By then, it is essential that everyone is in place.

647
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:10,548
I want everyone to fall in the part to the core ...

648
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,117
It is a very complex operation.

649
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:15,850
And we will need extreme concentration.

650
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,643
We will have access to the video surveillance system.

651
00:40:20,996 --> 00:40:24,676
None of the security in the whole area. Not even the security of the hospital.

652
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:26,770
Nor flying in the immediate vicinity.

653
00:40:26,856 --> 00:40:31,052
We'll spread a nice red carpet to that fucker up to Angel's bed.

654
00:40:31,192 --> 00:40:33,057
Where will you find Lobo.

655
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:35,653
And Agent Valmaseda will take over from María Carmen.

656
00:40:35,952 --> 00:40:38,890
They will be there waiting for him to welcome him.

657
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,823
Remember that we are looking for a middle-aged man.

658
00:40:41,854 --> 00:40:44,260
There will be twenty agents and he will be alone.

659
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,327
It is difficult to escape.

660
00:41:11,244 --> 00:41:12,555
You did?

661
00:41:18,162 --> 00:41:19,570
Give me, fast.

662
00:41:27,578 --> 00:41:28,696
It is charged.

663
00:41:29,223 --> 00:41:30,385
It is charged.

664
00:41:30,411 --> 00:41:32,191
Just pack up banknotes ...

665
00:41:32,192 --> 00:41:33,872
and put away those you can.

666
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:35,314
We're leaving.

667
00:41:35,315 --> 00:41:37,439
Here. Put them away.

668
00:41:37,553 --> 00:41:38,671
Here.

669
00:41:38,899 --> 00:41:40,078
Fast!

670
00:41:40,817 --> 00:41:42,023
We're leaving.

671
00:41:42,107 --> 00:41:43,445
It also lasted too much.

672
00:41:43,446 --> 00:41:44,620
Fuck.

673
00:41:46,202 --> 00:41:47,285
Come on.

674
00:41:57,495 --> 00:41:59,148
Fifth day of seizure.

675
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,850
<i> A hostage and two wounded policemen. </ i>

<i> It's the first time that a television crew enters the scenario ... </ i>

686
00:42:27,181 --> 00:42:29,453
They open the doors. Spare men, watch out.

687
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,290
Stop by the foot of the stairs as they requested.

- Hello, good morning. - Good morning.

703
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:26,722
I am Andrés de Fonollosa.

704
00:43:26,723 --> 00:43:28,410
Thank you both for coming.

705
00:43:28,493 --> 00:43:30,275
Can you put this, please?

706
00:43:30,392 --> 00:43:31,392
Yes.

Please come with me. Come on.

These are the eleven hostages ...

720
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,355
that will finally be released.

721
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:09,566
Here they are.

722
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:11,000
I acknowledge...

723
00:44:11,413 --> 00:44:12,725
Manuel Garcia.

724
00:44:13,363 --> 00:44:14,701
Alfonso Martínez.

725
00:44:15,044 --> 00:44:16,046
And María Cornejo.

726
00:44:16,047 --> 00:44:17,525
It really seems to release them.

727
00:44:17,526 --> 00:44:19,046
<i> We're all nervous. </ i>

728
00:44:19,047 --> 00:44:20,407
Prepare medical assistance.

729
00:44:20,431 --> 00:44:23,834
<i> Almost like children about to go out during recreation. </ i>

730
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:26,329
I want to thank everyone.

731
00:44:27,802 --> 00:44:30,115
For the audacity and courage ...

732
00:44:31,013 --> 00:44:32,383
that you have demonstrated.

733
00:44:33,897 --> 00:44:34,929
and right now... you are?

734
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,250
to you in particular ...

735
00:44:37,638 --> 00:44:39,209
to you and your creature.

736
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:42,838
You have proven to be a strong woman.

737
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:45,929
Because you decided right now,

738
00:44:45,964 --> 00:44:48,221
after five days of captivity ...

739
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,154
<i> to free the hostages? </ i>

740
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:51,435
<i> Five days. </ i>

741
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:54,795
<i> It seems impossible to believe that only a few days have passed, is not it? </ i>

742
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,288
You see ...

743
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:07,078
we must confess that it is a difficult time for us ...

744
00:45:07,234 --> 00:45:08,954
<i> the situation is critical. </ i>

745
00:45:11,091 --> 00:45:13,263
<i> We just have to give up. </ i>

746
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,321
<i> And that's why you're here. </ i>

747
00:45:21,231 --> 00:45:23,957
This gesture is the beginning of the end for everyone.

748
00:45:25,738 --> 00:45:26,776
Helsinki.

749
00:45:30,252 --> 00:45:31,449
The moment has come.

750
00:45:31,924 --> 00:45:33,072
They can go.

751
00:45:35,307 --> 00:45:36,334
Thank you.

752
00:45:44,294 --> 00:45:45,639
Snipers ready.

753
00:45:45,824 --> 00:45:47,683
Squad one assault, keep your distance.

754
00:45:48,247 --> 00:45:49,306
Got it.

755
00:45:58,819 --> 00:46:02,326
We will begin to free the hostages and try to negotiate a surrender ...

756
00:46:02,348 --> 00:46:04,168
that meets our interests.

757
00:46:04,169 --> 00:46:06,148
<i> Have you decided to give yourself to the police? </ i>

758
00:46:06,149 --> 00:46:08,804
<i> We realized we had lost. </ i>

759
00:46:10,126 --> 00:46:11,799
Open the doors!

760
00:46:15,471 --> 00:46:19,502
<i> - Eleven released, we see them. Finally ... </ i> - They are coming out.

761
00:46:19,631 --> 00:46:22,346
<i> good news from the State Mint. </ i>

762
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:26,446
<i> Here they are, a very emotional moment. </ i>

763
00:46:26,447 --> 00:46:28,544
<i> It seems the band starts to give in. </ i>

764
00:46:28,545 --> 00:46:31,363
<i> But there's more news, great news. </ i>

765
00:46:31,703 --> 00:46:35,434
<i> Fonollosa recognizes that the situation is critical, </ i>

766
00:46:35,535 --> 00:46:38,165
<i> who are forced to surrender. </ i>

767
00:46:38,216 --> 00:46:42,732
<i> The exact words were: "This is the beginning of the end." </ i>

768
00:46:42,757 --> 00:46:43,779
and right now... you are?

769
00:46:43,783 --> 00:46:47,085
"We realized we had lost".

770
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,215
I do not know if you've ever seen a body before.

771
00:46:55,297 --> 00:46:57,706
Even for some of us it is the first time.

772
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,043
<i> She came here to tell the truth. </ i>

773
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,347
<i> Here, this is the truth. </ i>

774
00:47:05,716 --> 00:47:07,409
<i> We've been beaten, </ i>

775
00:47:09,372 --> 00:47:11,104
<i> we have been defeated. </ i>

776
00:47:11,126 --> 00:47:13,436
<i> It is important to confirm this ... </ i>

777
00:47:13,654 --> 00:47:14,829
<i> please. </ i>

778
00:47:18,098 --> 00:47:19,117
Yes.

779
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,447
<i> There is no beat, he is dead. </ i>

780
00:47:21,478 --> 00:47:23,773
The hostages who escaped hit him in the head.

781
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:26,115
He died after a couple of hours.

782
00:47:26,896 --> 00:47:29,138
It's possible for people out there,

783
00:47:29,168 --> 00:47:31,210
this man is nothing but a thief.

784
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:37,673
But for us it was a companion and a friend.

785
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,603
Nobody prepares you for such a thing.

786
00:47:39,939 --> 00:47:43,796
Nobody. It is one of the reasons that led us to free the hostages.

787
00:47:44,621 --> 00:47:48,756
<i> Some of us have always thought that they would not come out alive here, but ... </ i>

788
00:47:48,757 --> 00:47:51,032
<i> I never thought it would be him. </ i>

789
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,799
What does it mean?

790
00:47:52,811 --> 00:47:54,530
There were people in the group ...

791
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,192
ready to sacrifice?

792
00:47:56,544 --> 00:47:57,683
No, no.

793
00:47:58,653 --> 00:47:59,806
No

794
00:47:59,824 --> 00:48:02,206
I did not mean that. We are simple people.

795
00:48:02,783 --> 00:48:05,498
People who lived hard times ...

796
00:48:07,214 --> 00:48:08,401
of various kinds...

797
00:48:08,644 --> 00:48:09,875
like anyone else.

798
00:48:10,225 --> 00:48:13,816
Including terminal diseases. And we saw ourselves forced to ...

799
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:18,511
take such desperate action to leave something for our families.

800
00:48:19,951 --> 00:48:22,378
To leave something to our loved ones.

801
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,796
Excuse me. excuse me.

802
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:42,188
I, for example, suffer from a degenerative disease called Herbert's myopathy.

803
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:44,610
The police knew about it ...

804
00:48:45,742 --> 00:48:49,125
<i> and have not scruples to spread lies about me. </ i>

805
00:48:50,459 --> 00:48:52,842
<i> I'd like to tell him something. I can also be a thief ... </ i>

806
00:48:54,044 --> 00:48:57,901
<i> I have always been, I have robbed banks, robbed jewelers ... </ i>

807
00:48:57,925 --> 00:49:01,562
<i> and cleaned up villas, but I've never sold anyone. </ i>

808
00:49:05,595 --> 00:49:07,803
I've never sold a woman.

809
00:49:08,781 --> 00:49:10,701
I'm not an exploiter ...

810
00:49:11,223 --> 00:49:12,544
who traffics ...

811
00:49:13,657 --> 00:49:16,714
and violent minors, I'm not like that.

812
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:22,292
Ask the police out there that they have evidence against me.

813
00:49:22,818 --> 00:49:26,199
Are you saying that the police lied to the public?

814
00:49:26,808 --> 00:49:28,405
The police mind.

815
00:49:30,082 --> 00:49:32,133
Mind to public opinion,

816
00:49:33,112 --> 00:49:34,830
he lied to my friends,

817
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:37,464
has defamed the name of my family.

818
00:49:43,086 --> 00:49:44,290
I'm a thief.

819
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:49,358
But I have the right, like everyone, not to be defamed.

820
00:49:51,515 --> 00:49:54,004
I have the same direct as any other person ...

821
00:49:54,086 --> 00:49:55,878
to die in peace.

822
00:49:58,394 --> 00:49:59,532
And with dignity.

823
00:50:01,742 --> 00:50:04,215
I can not continue, enough. Please stop.

824
00:50:05,195 --> 00:50:07,536
That morning there was no talk of anything else in the world.

825
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,651
People were speechless in bars and taxis.

826
00:50:10,665 --> 00:50:13,156
<i> Fonollosa claims that the police lie ... </ i>

827
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:16,764
<i> that the Ministry of the Interior would be polluting the news about its past. </ i>

828
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:19,213
<i> And challenge them to show proof. </ i>

829
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:22,923
We were Cameroon playing against Brazil without shoes.

830
00:50:23,128 --> 00:50:24,677
And everyone was rooting for us.

831
00:50:24,678 --> 00:50:29,047
<i> They ask us the line from the news. Cristina Saavedra, to you the line. </ I>

832
00:50:29,115 --> 00:50:33,403
<i> Last time: Deputy Inspector Ángel Rubio could come out of the coma. </ i>

833
00:50:33,533 --> 00:50:37,063
<i> He was in a pharmacological coma after a car accident. </ i>

834
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:41,641
<i> Recall that the deputy inspector had an accident on the M-506. </ i>

835
00:50:41,692 --> 00:50:45,848
<i> His car crashed into a prefabricated shed in one of the lanes ... </ i>

836
00:50:45,859 --> 00:50:47,556
<i> and turned over several times. </ i>

837
00:50:51,372 --> 00:50:52,434
Teacher...

838
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,535
<i> did you see us on television? </ i>

839
00:50:53,569 --> 00:50:57,124
Nairobi, I want you to row in unison like a rowing crew, clear?

840
00:50:57,965 --> 00:50:59,210
You must tell Rio ...

841
00:50:59,238 --> 00:51:02,411
that as a captain of the ship, I will take out Tokyo of prison, whatever the cost.

842
00:51:02,437 --> 00:51:04,437
Now yes that I recognize my Professor!

843
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,628
Pass me Berlin.

844
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:07,898
Berlin.

845
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,066
Me?

846
00:51:11,776 --> 00:51:12,833
Yes you.

847
00:51:16,676 --> 00:51:17,692
Thank you.

848
00:51:24,226 --> 00:51:25,283
"Yeah!

849
00:51:25,284 --> 00:51:28,364
The deputy inspector Rubio is about to leave the coma.

850
00:51:29,179 --> 00:51:31,025
How many chances are it true?

851
00:51:31,303 --> 00:51:32,315
I don't know.

852
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:35,881
It's a naive find of the police.

853
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:39,154
They say the victim leaves the coma and you go to the hospital to finish it.

854
00:51:39,163 --> 00:51:41,254
It does not even work in afternoon dramas.

855
00:51:48,668 --> 00:51:50,163
And if it were not so?

856
00:51:53,804 --> 00:51:56,532
It is the only one who knows who I am, the only outstanding issue.

857
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:57,903
In which room is he hospitalized?

858
00:51:58,714 --> 00:52:00,252
<i> In 119. </ i>

859
00:52:01,588 --> 00:52:02,785
It's a trap.

860
00:52:03,194 --> 00:52:04,245
Yes.

861
00:52:04,676 --> 00:52:07,383
It's a 90% trap.

862
00:52:07,546 --> 00:52:09,263
<i> 99%. </ i>

863
00:52:09,455 --> 00:52:11,804
To the

864
00:52:14,202 --> 00:52:17,193
- But do we want to leave that 1% to chance? - <i> No. </ i>

865
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:21,490
No, you'll have to go there to see if it's really a trap. And if it is not ...

866
00:52:21,864 --> 00:52:23,161
<i> you will have to do it out. </ i>

867
00:52:24,487 --> 00:52:26,646
Enter a hospital ...

868
00:52:26,891 --> 00:52:31,717
where there will probably be at least 50 policemen waiting for me.

869
00:52:33,128 --> 00:52:35,419
<i> Come on, Sergio, think, fuck! </ i>

870
00:52:36,493 --> 00:52:38,782
You spent half your childhood in a hospital.

871
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:42,411
There must be a way to end up in a trap without getting caught,

872
00:52:42,448 --> 00:52:44,762
<i> knowing that there is the cavalry waiting for you. </ i>

873
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:57,967
The solution...

874
00:53:01,572 --> 00:53:03,862
is to unseat ...

875
00:53:05,161 --> 00:53:06,551
the cavalry.

876
00:53:22,944 --> 00:53:25,198
A moment of attention, please.

877
00:53:25,593 --> 00:53:26,706
So,

878
00:53:27,492 --> 00:53:31,914
as you know, we released the hostages who chose freedom,

879
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:34,582
so here nobody was deceived ...

880
00:53:34,698 --> 00:53:36,588
we kept our promise.

881
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,044
The promise, a couple of balls.

882
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:41,515
And, in the same way, I swear to you that the million ...

883
00:53:41,545 --> 00:53:44,434
the million will be delivered to the addresses you have provided.

884
00:53:44,435 --> 00:53:46,000
Lies and more lies.

885
00:53:46,407 --> 00:53:49,555
We will also keep this promise, you have my word.

886
00:54:44,669 --> 00:54:46,196
Attention, to all units!

887
00:54:46,224 --> 00:54:48,150
Identify whoever enters.

888
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:49,242
<I> Roger that. </ I>

889
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,131
Excuse me, you!

890
00:54:58,639 --> 00:54:59,912
<i> A clown has entered. </ i>

891
00:55:00,412 --> 00:55:01,768
He could be masked.

892
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:03,533
Another is entering the emergency room.

893
00:55:04,688 --> 00:55:05,952
What the fuck is going on?

894
00:55:10,946 --> 00:55:12,199
Others are entering.

895
00:55:12,954 --> 00:55:14,310
What the fuck is going on?

896
00:55:17,646 --> 00:55:18,951
They called me too.

897
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:30,560
Get them out of there.

898
00:55:31,549 --> 00:55:34,045
From here we do not pass, out.

899
00:56:09,441 --> 00:56:10,640
GAMES ROOM.

900
00:56:24,498 --> 00:56:27,725
Who wants a fun crazy rabbit?

901
00:56:31,223 --> 00:56:34,348
<i> Inspector, they have posted an announcement for a nonexistent casting. </ i>

902
00:56:42,124 --> 00:56:44,740
Lobo, be careful, it could be in the building.

903
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:07,795
<i> He's about to enter the room. </ i>

904
00:57:12,475 --> 00:57:14,610
What's happening, someone tell me something?

905
00:57:27,282 --> 00:57:29,160
False alarm, it was not him.

906
00:57:54,569 --> 00:57:56,734
Inspector, the TV interview.

907
00:57:57,210 --> 00:58:01,212
<i> As verified by this network, there are no open proceedings against Fonollosa ... </ i>

915
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,776
Me neither.

916
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:30,153
Leave.

917
00:58:36,511 --> 00:58:37,547
Listen to me.

918
00:58:39,162 --> 00:58:41,781
As soon as Helsinki leaves, we move, okay?

919
00:58:41,782 --> 00:58:43,399
Are you sure it's time?

920
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,440
Mónica, I have a gun, while he has one to save.

921
00:58:46,453 --> 00:58:47,924
What do you think can go wrong?

922
00:59:00,424 --> 00:59:02,480
Or you tell her or I'll tell her.

923
00:59:03,086 --> 00:59:04,440
I'll tell him.

924
00:59:08,025 --> 00:59:10,130
The Professor will try to free Tokyo.

925
00:59:25,533 --> 00:59:26,800
Where are you going?

926
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:31,200
Whore.

927
00:59:33,209 --> 00:59:34,779
Where the fuck are you going?

928
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:39,503
What's wrong, is it recreation? Come on, everyone seated.

929
00:59:39,504 --> 00:59:41,918
And it's the same for you, phenomenon, it's a bad day.

930
00:59:41,919 --> 00:59:44,568
You know what? I really want to smash someone's nose.

931
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:47,224
And yours attracts me a lot, you know how it is.

932
00:59:49,847 --> 00:59:52,840
Well, why do not you try my gun, let's see if you calm down?

933
00:59:55,445 --> 00:59:56,445
Arturo.

934
00:59:57,428 --> 00:59:58,796
Arturito.

935
00:59:59,423 --> 01:00:03,078
You have a toy gun and I have my balls turned. What are you doing?

936
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:04,240
Toy?

937
01:00:05,338 --> 01:00:06,338
No

938
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:08,300
Fuck, I do not think so.

939
01:00:09,318 --> 01:00:10,836
Why do not we verify it?

940
01:00:11,784 --> 01:00:14,619
This time I give you three seconds, damn bitch.

941
01:00:14,663 --> 01:00:16,276
- These are two ... - Three ...

942
01:00:17,077 --> 01:00:18,077
Two

943
01:00:20,911 --> 01:00:21,911
One

944
01:00:26,221 --> 01:00:27,327
Surprise.

945
01:00:32,855 --> 01:00:34,666
Rio, smile a little.

946
01:00:35,062 --> 01:00:36,141
Because...

947
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:38,400
we can go back to being a family.

948
01:00:45,091 --> 01:00:46,383
Turn around.

949
01:00:49,173 --> 01:00:52,240
I said to turn around.

950
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,920
Son of a bitch.

951
01:00:57,324 --> 01:01:00,320
Come on. Quick, move.

952
01:01:01,842 --> 01:01:03,136
They'll run.

953
01:01:04,622 --> 01:01:05,856
They'll run.

954
01:01:06,302 --> 01:01:07,798
- Who? - Hostages.

955
01:01:10,321 --> 01:01:14,230
Come on, come on, we do not have the whole day. Mónica, open the door.

956
01:01:14,231 --> 01:01:18,528
Mónica, do not listen to him, he's taking advantage of you.

957
01:01:18,529 --> 01:01:20,099
Do not open the door!

958
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:24,169
You shut up, or you get a shot, phenomenon.

959
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:26,537
Do not listen to him, open the door and we'll leave from here.

960
01:01:29,638 --> 01:01:31,989
SAFETY SYSTEM: DOOR IN BLOCK.

961
01:01:38,022 --> 01:01:40,202
SAFETY SYSTEM: DOOR IN BLOCK.

962
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:41,489
Power.

963
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,457
What happens?

964
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,534
- Does not open. - Fuck.

965
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:55,982
These motherfuckers have locked the door, fuck!

966
01:01:55,983 --> 01:01:57,233
It was me.

967
01:01:57,234 --> 01:02:00,538
- Back! - Arturo, throw the gun.

968
01:02:00,952 --> 01:02:02,674
Throw the gun.

969
01:02:03,194 --> 01:02:04,194
Arturito ...

970
01:02:05,314 --> 01:02:08,917
I know that you really like cinema, but this film is getting away from you a little bit.

971
01:02:08,918 --> 01:02:10,770
Not another step or I shoot him.

972
01:02:10,771 --> 01:02:14,156
I probably will not leave alive, but this one will never laugh again.

973
01:02:14,889 --> 01:02:16,566
Berlin, Berlin, calm.

974
01:02:21,517 --> 01:02:22,965
Open the door!

975
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,040
Okay, okay.

976
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:26,683
Quiet.

977
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:29,984
Let's talk about it from civilians.

978
01:02:30,365 --> 01:02:31,471
Leave him...

979
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,884
and if you want to go out, I'll help you.

980
01:02:33,885 --> 01:02:36,480
Open the door for me now.

981
01:02:39,363 --> 01:02:41,362
We do not open any doors.

982
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:43,355
Do you really think that?

983
01:02:44,143 --> 01:02:46,864
Look, I count up to five and then I shoot him.

984
01:02:47,553 --> 01:02:50,442
I have nothing to lose and I do not give a shit about anything.

985
01:02:50,593 --> 01:02:52,400
So the choice is yours.

986
01:02:52,431 --> 01:02:53,433
Five...

987
01:02:53,489 --> 01:02:54,495
fo

988
01:02:54,612 --> 01:02:55,612
Three...

989
01:02:55,841 --> 01:02:56,841
Two

990
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:57,973
One

991
01:03:23,368 --> 01:03:25,096
But how did he find out?

992
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:27,173
He had a remote controlled GoPro.

993
01:03:27,174 --> 01:03:28,329
Piece of shit.

994
01:03:28,345 --> 01:03:30,254
We are trying to trace the signal.

995
01:03:30,255 --> 01:03:32,335
It's useless, it's too late now.

996
01:03:33,031 --> 01:03:34,487
They screwed us again.

997
01:03:34,612 --> 01:03:36,540
What is clear is that you were right,

998
01:03:36,585 --> 01:03:39,281
that son of a bitch tried to get rid of Ángel.

999
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:42,735
So Ángel will have been very close to the subject to get the evidence

1000
01:03:42,972 --> 01:03:45,787
It is possible that they found themselves face to face.

1001
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,647
You will forgive me but ...

1002
01:03:50,829 --> 01:03:52,079
I'm exhausted.

1003
01:04:14,946 --> 01:04:17,252
<i> Leave a message after the beep ... </ i>

1004
01:04:18,134 --> 01:04:19,630
Save, I'm Raquel ...

1005
01:04:20,558 --> 01:04:23,547
Nothing, I'm going to get a coffee at the Hanoi ...

1006
01:04:23,724 --> 01:04:25,340
I'll tell you if I wanted to join you.

1007
01:04:25,682 --> 01:04:27,040
It would do me good to talk.

1008
01:05:05,853 --> 01:05:06,853
Antonio.

1009
01:05:07,156 --> 01:05:09,088
Keep me, they left me an envelope for her.

1010
01:05:10,389 --> 01:05:11,389
Who?

1011
01:05:11,392 --> 01:05:14,309
I do not know, it was in the pocket when we opened. What do I bring you?

1012
01:05:15,024 --> 01:05:16,200
A beer.

1013
01:05:43,441 --> 01:05:45,000
How was your day?

1014
01:05:57,197 --> 01:05:58,848
Well, I think it's fine.

1015
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:00,771
No

1016
01:06:00,963 --> 01:06:02,141
It was horrible.

1017
01:06:03,425 --> 01:06:06,771
I organized an operation to leave with you tomorrow ...

1018
01:06:07,637 --> 01:06:09,591
towards these beaches, but ...

1019
01:06:10,187 --> 01:06:11,554
it was a disaster.

1020
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:14,321
- What do I bring you? - The same.

1021
01:06:15,767 --> 01:06:16,867
Raquel ...

1022
01:06:18,597 --> 01:06:20,555
sooner or later all this will end.

1023
01:06:23,158 --> 01:06:25,740
So, you and I will meet at the beach.

1024
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:30,640
But you have to choose a place.

1025
01:06:31,781 --> 01:06:34,706
Okay, okay. I did not have time.

1026
01:06:34,862 --> 01:06:35,959
Let's see ...

1027
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:39,776
What do you think about choosing it together?

1028
01:06:39,797 --> 01:06:41,037
I say it's a great idea.

1029
01:06:42,575 --> 01:06:45,631
- Choose one ... - What a responsibility. Let's see ...

1030
01:06:52,232 --> 01:06:53,349
Palawan.

1031
01:06:53,702 --> 01:06:54,811
Palawan.

1032
01:06:55,287 --> 01:06:56,387
Let me see.

1033
01:06:57,031 --> 01:06:58,284
Wonderful.

1034
01:06:58,749 --> 01:07:00,000
But where?

1035
01:07:00,409 --> 01:07:03,517
Palawan, yes. It is an island in the Philippines.

1036
01:07:05,573 --> 01:07:09,197
It is located south-east of the archipelago, it is a little higher up ...

1037
01:07:09,198 --> 01:07:14,965
of the island of Borneo. It has 849 thousand inhabitants, more or less and ...

1038
01:07:15,293 --> 01:07:17,960
the capital is Puerto Princesa.

1039
01:07:20,761 --> 01:07:23,287
Ángel will have been very close to the subject to get the proof.

1040
01:07:23,288 --> 01:07:25,310
It is possible that they found themselves face to face.

1041
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,225
Did you check it?

1042
01:07:26,226 --> 01:07:29,200
Because I do. Did you do your fucking job?

1043
01:07:30,896 --> 01:07:33,673
The best beaches of thin sand ...

1044
01:07:33,822 --> 01:07:35,160
of all the tropics.

1045
01:07:40,123 --> 01:07:41,547
Do not you like the Philippines?

1046
01:07:44,922 --> 01:07:46,518
<i> In the next episode ... </ i>

1047
01:07:50,031 --> 01:07:52,752
It's a wonderful moment.

1048
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:56,709
Standing.

1049
01:07:57,546 --> 01:08:00,779
You will work until your hands bleed.

1050
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:04,630
I want you to arm the streets, ports and airports.

1051
01:08:06,404 --> 01:08:07,573
Take off your clothes.

1052
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:10,348
This for not having killed when it was necessary.

1053
01:08:10,349 --> 01:08:11,496
Turn around.

1054
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:14,249
Do not lie to me, I would understand it.

1055
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,899
Who do you think stole your gun?

1056
01:08:17,463 --> 01:08:18,959
You do not understand it.

1057
01:08:19,852 --> 01:08:24,040
What should I do to make myself respected?

1058
01:08:24,246 --> 01:08:25,883
What should I do?

1059
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:32,039
What have you done? What the fuck did you do?

1060
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:33,720
It was either she or us.

1061
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:48,920
Attention, we activate the "Cage" operation.

1062
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:53,635
To the ground. All on the ground!

1063
01:08:53,636 --> 01:08:56,479
- Shoot the lens! - What the fuck is going on? Power!

1064
01:09:06,087 --> 01:09:07,929
