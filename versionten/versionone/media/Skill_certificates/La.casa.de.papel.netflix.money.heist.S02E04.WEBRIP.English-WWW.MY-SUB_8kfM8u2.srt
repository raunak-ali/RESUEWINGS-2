﻿1
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,911
THE EVENTS AND THE SCENES TO BE FOLLOWED ARE THE FANTASY PRODUCT.

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,980
<i> Inspector, we found the farm. </ i>

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,175
<i> The one who helped them was here, </ i> less than 30 hours ago.

4
00:00:18,295 --> 00:00:21,160
- <i> He called Alberto. - That they wanted to wipe out </ i>

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,960
<i> they would burn it in. </ i>

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,720
And I in Madrid was going. I would take the bus.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,522
<i> Get out of the car. </ i>

8
00:00:27,642 --> 00:00:28,983
Old story!

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,872
<i> You are being taken </ i> for an attack on the Authority.

10
00:00:35,992 --> 00:00:37,860
<i> I get from the Department. They arrested me. </ I>

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,662
I do not know how he was hurt so I did not touch him.

12
00:00:40,782 --> 00:00:43,732
- <i> Take his handcuffs. - What are you gonna do to me? </ I>

13
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:46,665
Real!

14
00:00:47,592 --> 00:00:50,442
Who is the Professor? Very well. Take it!

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,158
Sergio! The Professor is called Sergio Marcina.

16
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:57,428
<i> I will ask for imprisonment without suspension and communication. </ i>

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,766
Let's go.

18
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,229
I chop the cider in a few days and we leave for the Caribbean.

19
00:01:07,975 --> 00:01:10,667
Look at her. It is beautiful and elegant.

20
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:13,615
- She is a woman of another class. - I understood!

21
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:16,503
I'm a shit and I have to dream like a shit.

22
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:18,702
You have a syndrome. Of Stockholm.

23
00:01:18,822 --> 00:01:21,580
You keep on your way, I am my own and all right.

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,080
<i> Inspector Rubio will come out of the coma. </ i>

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,827
- He's the only one who knows me. - You have to go see if it's a trap

26
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:31,337
- if not, kill him. - We'll lay on this bastard

27
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:34,974
red carpet to the bed of nell. <i> There will be Lobo waiting for him. </ i>

28
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,144
<i> It's very difficult to escape. </ i>

29
00:01:44,324 --> 00:01:47,013
In that office they keep the bag with the fake weapons.

30
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:49,280
- Who's going to get the gun? - <i> Monica. </ i>

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,650
<i> While she is being treated. </ i>

32
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:54,024
Where the hell are you going?

33
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,904
You have a gun and I can not stand it.

34
00:01:58,024 --> 00:01:59,800
Why do not we try it out?

35
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,240
Go on the other.

36
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,960
Come on, fast! Monica, open the door!

37
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,545
I will count as five, and then I will drop it.

38
00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:09,765
Monica, do not open the door!

39
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,658
<i> Rachel </ i>

40
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,550
this, sooner or later, will end.

41
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,410
And then, we both will be on the beach.

42
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,610
But you have to choose a place.

43
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,510
Good. I did not get to see. Well

44
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,650
What do you think we both chose together?

45
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,315
It looks perfect to me.

46
00:02:38,606 --> 00:02:41,320
- Choose one. - Big responsibility! Well

47
00:02:48,237 --> 00:02:49,430
Palawan.

48
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,080
Palawan.

49
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,441
To see.

50
00:02:52,948 --> 00:02:54,103
Wonderful.

51
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:56,072
Where is;

52
00:02:56,382 --> 00:02:59,171
Palawan is an island of the Philippines.

53
00:03:01,596 --> 00:03:03,704
It is located northwest of the Archipelago

54
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:06,136
just above the Borneo Island.

55
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:09,800
It has about 849,000 inhabitants

56
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,455
and the capital is Puerto Princesa.

57
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:19,367
<i> O'Nchel approached him enough if he had proof. </ i>

58
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:21,329
<i> They may have come face to face. </ i>

59
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:24,800
<i> You searched for him? I did it! Did you do your job? </ I>

60
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:29,540
Better beaches with fine sand

61
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:31,623
across the Tropic.

62
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:38,206
Do not you like the Philippines?

63
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:45,467
Yes

64
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,813
Of course!

65
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,314
Does it hurt to take a moment on the toilet?

66
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:55,489
Not at all.

67
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:34,453
Suarett?

68
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,470
A question.

69
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:41,354
What color was the clown's wig talking with the kid in the hospital?

70
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:48,618
- Was it red? - <i> Yes. </ i>

71
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,569
- For sure; - <i> Yes. </ i>

72
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:14,767
<i> To make your life pieces, it's the same if you're in a toilet </ i>

73
00:05:14,887 --> 00:05:16,520
Three two

74
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,906
one!

75
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,074
<i> in a robbery </ i>

76
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
<i> or at the entrance of the prison. </ i>

77
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,599
<i> You see </ i>

78
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,860
<i> That evening, the mishaps of three women would be synchronized. </ i>

79
00:05:40,984 --> 00:05:44,534
<i> Rachel suddenly understood that she had fallen in love with the balls </ i>

80
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,100
<i> the greatest robber of Spain. </ i>

81
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,188
It's theirs.

82
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:52,885
It's with them, you've seen it all! It's with them!

83
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,480
<i> Monica Gustanblue understood that he had just become a bandit accomplices </ i>

84
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:00,759
<i> and that there was no return. </ i>

85
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:04,246
<i> And me </ i>

86
00:06:04,593 --> 00:06:08,493
<i> I walked following the instructions given to us by the Professor. </ i>

87
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,302
<i> But without any certainty </ i>

88
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:13,478
<i> as if it were swollen. </ i>

89
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,670
<i> Like a bottle that flew into the sea </ i>

90
00:06:17,852 --> 00:06:21,380
<i> without knowing if it will be picked up on the opposite bank. </ i>

91
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,867
<i> If they catch you </ i>

92
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:26,987
at 24 hours of arrest, you will say you want to make an agreement.

93
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,709
That you want to file, but an Investigator.

94
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:33,549
They will have no other solution than to go to the Supreme Court.

95
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:36,389
And it is likely during your transfer

96
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,690
to be able to do something for you.

97
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,150
<i> That's where I was going, </ i>

98
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,980
<i> To the Court. </ i>

99
00:06:46,662 --> 00:06:51,012
<i> In the hope that my guardian angel would know the route of the vehicle </ i>

100
00:06:51,698 --> 00:06:54,449
<i> and it would save me a second life. </ i>

101
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:08,046
<i> It was hard to have hopes on a van </ i>

102
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,780
<i> guarded and handcuffed. </ i>

103
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,195
<i> But it would be worse if i knew that at the same time </ i>

104
00:07:15,315 --> 00:07:17,215
<i> 20 km from </ i>

105
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:20,707
<i> my guardian angel had just been discovered. </ i>

106
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:34,175


107
00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:38,494


108
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:25,041


109
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,929
<b> <i> THE PAPER HOUSE </ i> </ b>

110
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:42,694
<b> TUESDAY 16:35 </ b>

111
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:47,557
<b> 102 HOURS FROM THE PRINCIPLE </ b>

112
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:57,704
Rachel?

113
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,184
Alberto

114
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,349
have you analyzed the evidence you found in the Toledo fireplace?

115
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,381
Yes, but nothing positive.

116
00:09:08,305 --> 00:09:09,819
<i> What's a good thing? </ i>

117
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:13,433
They were the remains of a recent sports newspaper.

118
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,430
Or the data is falsified

119
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,300
or the guy reads sports on Sundays.

120
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,440
I do.

121
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,924
'k

122
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,140
how exactly did the fight with Salvah?

123
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,641
<i> Damn, Rachel </ i>

124
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,330
<i> I told you it was not a fight. </ i>

125
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:34,584
He grabbed me from the neck, made a grip and I fainted. I did not touch him.

126
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:36,445
It's ninja with glasses.

127
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,744
Why are you asking me;

128
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,176
Nothing.

129
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,683
And you say that he caused you.

130
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,593
<i> Yes. He told me that I share my intelligence with my penis </ i>

131
00:09:51,713 --> 00:09:54,463
and something such wise, among others.

132
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,044
He wanted a fight, but why?

133
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,970
I do not know.

134
00:09:59,486 --> 00:10:00,529
Goodbye.

135
00:10:04,757 --> 00:10:05,902
Alberto?

136
00:10:32,102 --> 00:10:35,595
Do not touch the trays. They are sealed up again.

137
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:40,379
Take the imprints and compare them with the nell's tsp.

138
00:10:41,262 --> 00:10:42,912
- You 're kidding me. - No.

139
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:52,522
Then go to my car and take fingerprints from the passenger's door.

140
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:54,092
- But do it.

141
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,795
We're looking for a guy

142
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:10,315
middle age with beard and glasses.

143
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,676
You!

144
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:16,641
You! See who he is and what he does here.

145
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,499
<i> It was him. </ i>

146
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:23,357
<i> And of course it was he. </ i>

147
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:25,939
- Do you have a charger? - No.

148
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,765
Do you want to get from mine?

149
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:33,125
<i> He was from the beginning. </ i>

150
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,218
<i> Always polite </ i>

151
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,560
<i> always with the smile </ i>

152
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,568
<i> and always in the right place. </ i>

153
00:11:42,991 --> 00:11:45,659
<i> The only citizen who had entered the scene. </ i>

154
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,429
I think something is happening to your daughter.

155
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:56,141
<i> The stranger who managed to overcome all her defenses one by one. </ i>

156
00:11:57,668 --> 00:11:59,468
<i> And not just as a police officer. </ i>

157
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:17,942
Salvation

158
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,180
I have not

159
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,060
such a wonderful gift as yours

160
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,840
but I will improvise a surprise

161
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,990
in female toilets.

162
00:12:34,323 --> 00:12:37,044
You will go first and then I will come.

163
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,785
Rachel

164
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,283
the time is not right and here they know us.

165
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:48,503
Salvation?

166
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,797
It's the first time I do not wear a parachute

167
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,129
and I will fall into the pool.

168
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:01,664
Do not tell me he has no water.

169
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,360
And of course it does.

170
00:13:12,586 --> 00:13:13,985
Of course he has.

171
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,416
Well

172
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,770
go and wait with you there.

173
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:55,200
Hands on the wall!

174
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,740
- Rachel, what it is - Hands on the wall!

175
00:14:03,546 --> 00:14:05,280
What are you doing;

176
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,964
- Weapons? - Do I arrest? Rachel, please.

177
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:09,270
Go round.

178
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:14,580
- Put them on. - Rachel, I guess you're joking, eh?

179
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,939
Wear them!

180
00:14:39,314 --> 00:14:43,764
You are involved in synergy with hostage robbery at the National Mint.

181
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,306
- <i> You see </ i> - You are right

182
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:50,140
- <i> eventually, third and drugged. </ i> - Do not talk

183
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:52,234
and get to the Investigator.

184
00:14:52,354 --> 00:14:55,804
<i> And in this case he had more than suspicions. </ i>

185
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:57,920
<i> He was bitter </ i>

186
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:00,117
<i> had anger </ i>

187
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:02,780
<i> was disappointed. </ i>

188
00:15:18,975 --> 00:15:21,118
<i> And Helsinki felt something similar. </ i>

189
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:24,534
<i> Not from a spoof, but from a lack of sleep. </ i>

190
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,470
<i> He had slept four hours in the last five days. </ i>

191
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,650
<i> Do you know what a man does when he does not sleep? </ i>

192
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,221
<i> Neural synapses are short-circuiting. </ i>

193
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,944
<i> It stops secreting dopamine, ceases to metabolize glucose </ i>

194
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:42,940
<i> and the only information in the brain is survival. </ i>

195
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,940
<i> Only you can not ask someone who has five days without care </ i>

196
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,604
<i> is patience. </ i>

197
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,918
Let's go!

198
00:15:54,311 --> 00:15:55,898
Take your clothes off.

199
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,521
And the blouse.

200
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,102
- I have a wound on my shoulder - Take off your blouse!

201
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:34,835
You steal from above.

202
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,619
That's because you did not kill when you had to.

203
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:42,471
What will you do;

204
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,381
If I drop you

205
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,681
you will just die. You will not suffer.

206
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,620
Now you'll carry two pounds of explosives stuck on you

207
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,130
without knowing when to fire them.

208
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,035
Helsinki, are new explosives. Be careful, my friend.

209
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,060
This worm is worse than the cops.

210
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,380
Because of his death Oslo.

211
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:20,914
Because Denver is about to die.

212
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:24,599
That's it

213
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,980
the problems are over.

214
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:29,345
So, Arturite?

215
00:17:58,586 --> 00:18:00,389
If you pull out the cable

216
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,282
it will explode.

217
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:05,361
Do not make quick moves

218
00:18:05,571 --> 00:18:07,021
do not sweat

219
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,630
do not touch yourself.

220
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,039
The detonator.

221
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,657
If I push

222
00:18:23,355 --> 00:18:24,855
this button

223
00:18:29,814 --> 00:18:32,164
Nor will your wife recognize it

224
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,300
the pieces of Arturite.

225
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:50,691
Do you have a cigarette?

226
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,519
- Do you have a cigarette? - You are pregnant.

227
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:55,689
Pregnant, hostage, shot

228
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:59,630
and over and over accuse me of synergy in an armed spiral

229
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,550
Do not think the worst.

230
00:19:02,282 --> 00:19:05,732
Arturo will help you, he is your child's father.

231
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:08,570
Who father?

232
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:11,246
Who "gave" me as a common kidnapper?

233
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,313
Who father?

234
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:17,317
Where did I open my head with an iron pole?

235
00:19:17,606 --> 00:19:19,800
Most likely my companions will help me.

236
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,820
Besides, I just broke down their escape plan.

237
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,187
They'll set me up at three meters, of course. How stupid I am when I got fucked up!

238
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,384
Come on, give me a cigarette. I want an ass-cigarette!

239
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,341
They will not sit in the stool, because, I swear to you, I will crush them all.

240
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:39,899
- You will not crush anyone, calm down! - She's right, she got them on her throat!

241
00:19:40,124 --> 00:19:44,309
Whether we break it or stay and catch us, it will go to jail.

242
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:46,797
He has painted her, anyway.

243
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:52,160
Fuck!

244
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:57,474
I always make the wrong choices.

245
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,180
I always make the wrong choices.

246
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:05,239
I choose a married man

247
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:09,424
start a baby

248
00:20:11,504 --> 00:20:13,254
then another comes

249
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,890
shoots me on the foot

250
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:18,647
and I go

251
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:21,398
and I fall in love with him.

252
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:24,082
Do you know what we're gonna do?

253
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,300
- What; - Will you come with us.

254
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,400
After crossing the line, it's over. I will not leave you alone.

255
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,133
- My child, he can - He will come with us.

256
00:20:34,253 --> 00:20:36,789
It will take the position of Tokyo or Oslo and finally.

257
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:38,144
No, listen.

258
00:20:38,473 --> 00:20:40,368
I am a simple secretary.

259
00:20:41,696 --> 00:20:45,184
I do not think I can get it out of the Police, shoot it

260
00:20:45,304 --> 00:20:48,454
to live hidden, who knows where, in Cambodia

261
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:50,743
or any other country.

262
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,849
Better to stay.

263
00:20:55,652 --> 00:20:58,202
And when the police arrive, I'll tell them

264
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:03,511
that I did because I had the Stockholm Syndrome.

265
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,332
This scenario has some attenuators

266
00:21:07,563 --> 00:21:09,063
while the other, no.

267
00:21:15,814 --> 00:21:17,082
"Stockholm".

268
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:20,105
What;

269
00:21:21,219 --> 00:21:22,834
Sounds beautiful.

270
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:25,470
If you come with us

271
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,550
I could call you 'Stockholm'.

272
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,642
I do not know, man.

273
00:22:00,116 --> 00:22:01,130
Get out.

274
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:29,236
It's gone.

275
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:35,986
Go in.

276
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:53,188
<i> We were all exhausted. </ i>

277
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,038
<i> From insomnia </ i>

278
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:00,481
<i> anxiety </ i>

279
00:23:02,092 --> 00:23:04,750
<i> and the anguish to carry a secret a year </ i>

280
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:09,301
<i> in that strangling environment, it was getting harder to keep it. </ i>

281
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,164
<i> And all, sooner or later </ i>

282
00:23:13,732 --> 00:23:15,404
<i> We lost the ball. </ i>

283
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:17,376
<i> Except Berlin. </ i>

284
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:21,346
<i> He was the only one to apply restlessly the protocol of rest. </ i>

285
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:23,980
<i> The rest </ i>

286
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,161
<i> was upset. </ i>

287
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,716
I tried to be good.

288
00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:39,826
I tried to give you what they promised you.

289
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:42,798
Let me get rid of you from Berlin.

290
00:23:43,582 --> 00:23:46,192
Make all of this meaningful.

291
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,405
After all that I've lost here, it makes sense.

292
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,040
I am a good person.

293
00:23:56,405 --> 00:23:57,654
I was good.

294
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,220
And the world

295
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:03,360
it spits me down.

296
00:24:07,816 --> 00:24:10,962
I tried to give you oxygen

297
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,344
and you brought it back to me.

298
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,114
Berlin;

299
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:22,562
Berlin.

300
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:27,176
He spent over an hour and a half.

301
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:34,718
You did not want to kill me

302
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,154
while I was asleep?

303
00:24:38,338 --> 00:24:39,520
Not even a little;

304
00:24:44,154 --> 00:24:45,347
You laugh.

305
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,860
That means I'm not afraid anymore.

306
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:58,737
Let's say the anxiolytics I get have neutralized me.

307
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,960
If everything goes well

308
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,533
which is unlikely, if I do not think of reins

309
00:25:12,653 --> 00:25:13,752
but

310
00:25:15,326 --> 00:25:17,176
in case they go

311
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,747
I want to offer you a deal.

312
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:21,617
A romantic collaboration.

313
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:28,238
In a few days, I'll send you an air ticket.

314
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,043
For a very distant place.

315
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,980
If you want

316
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,730
you can come with me.

317
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,471
Very little time

318
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,420
many desires.

319
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:51,060
And after

320
00:25:52,706 --> 00:25:54,356
after my end

321
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,515
everything I have will belong to you.

322
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,189
It would be really wonderful

323
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:09,060
to love me a lot.

324
00:26:12,808 --> 00:26:13,973
Nevertheless

325
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,293
I do not live with expectations

326
00:26:17,537 --> 00:26:19,180
with hallucinations.

327
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,933
I have many defects

328
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,920
and I know it.

329
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,742
I can stand

330
00:26:29,126 --> 00:26:31,605
to become my partner

331
00:26:32,683 --> 00:26:34,383
on the last trip.

332
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,706
You and me together

333
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,284
until the end.

334
00:27:25,722 --> 00:27:27,281
You do not understand.

335
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,274
You do not understand.

336
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:36,381
What do I have to do to respect you?

337
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,000
What should I do;

338
00:27:39,248 --> 00:27:41,201
Cut an ear

339
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,110
and send it to your father?

340
00:27:44,452 --> 00:27:47,789
Or throw you on your leg and never again rejoice?

341
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:49,477
<i> Great idea! </ i>

342
00:27:53,155 --> 00:27:55,305
It is time to become practical.

343
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,728
The utopia of cooperation

344
00:28:01,864 --> 00:28:03,170
failed

345
00:28:04,662 --> 00:28:05,920
Nairobi.

346
00:28:10,512 --> 00:28:12,860
Thank you for letting me

347
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,667
to rest a little of my obligations.

348
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:18,987
But we are all prepared

349
00:28:19,107 --> 00:28:21,157
to return to headquarters.

350
00:28:22,858 --> 00:28:24,238
All yours.

351
00:28:30,988 --> 00:28:33,373
It's a wonderful time!

352
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,657
Stand up!

353
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:54,946
I told you

354
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:58,361
that I would protect you, right?

355
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,240
But I changed my mind.

356
00:29:05,505 --> 00:29:07,308
It is much more practical

357
00:29:09,034 --> 00:29:10,612
to torture you.

358
00:29:15,776 --> 00:29:17,980
In concentration camps

359
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:21,642
respect is taken for granted.

360
00:29:22,806 --> 00:29:24,618
It will be the same here.

361
00:29:25,801 --> 00:29:28,054
You will dig the tunnel

362
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:32,268
until your hands are bleeding!

363
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:39,079
At nights you can cry out of terror in your rack

364
00:29:39,394 --> 00:29:42,408
but then, you will continue to dig!

365
00:29:47,965 --> 00:29:50,753
You will do your job without a break

366
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,860
otherwise, an epic punishment is waiting for you.

367
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:58,882
Like your leader.

368
00:30:08,108 --> 00:30:11,150
A guy who, if he reborn, will kill.

369
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,807
If he again has a passion for freedom, he will kill!

370
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,040
Where to sweat a lot

371
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,492
will kill.

372
00:30:24,987 --> 00:30:27,409
A man with an explosive character.

373
00:30:32,454 --> 00:30:35,130
Now you will be afraid of them, Arturo.

374
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,840
Though we always knew you were doing it.

375
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:45,767
Since you are still, you will stay here separately.

376
00:30:45,964 --> 00:30:48,595
Helsinki, the rest in the tunnel!

377
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,020
Go ahead, go!

378
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:53,198
Quickly!

379
00:31:10,596 --> 00:31:13,143
Seismographs have detected unusual activity

380
00:31:13,263 --> 00:31:16,762
in the submountain of the Mint. Probably the robbers increased

381
00:31:16,882 --> 00:31:19,927
the pace of digging tunnels. They are ready to open it.

382
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:22,780
- How long does it stay? - Two meters, according to the geodatar.

383
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,150
- Two and a half. - Where will they end up?

384
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,100
We believe here.

385
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,595
In a collector about 15 meters behind the building.

386
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,800
Attention all! Be ready. Notify them to the ground.

387
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,860
I want 20 men to keep the collector.

388
00:31:52,701 --> 00:31:56,460
Do you know what the guilty people are doing when they go to the crime scene?

389
00:31:56,966 --> 00:31:58,666
They do not stop talking.

390
00:31:58,948 --> 00:32:00,998
For the time being, for politics

391
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:03,060
they say jokes

392
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,691
from anxiety.

393
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,775
Because they can not stand the silence.

394
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,161
But you

395
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:16,078
you do not say anything.

396
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,444
What do you mean, Rachel?

397
00:32:27,115 --> 00:32:28,392
Who you are;

398
00:32:29,068 --> 00:32:30,560
Sergio Marcina.

399
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,089
Sergio?

400
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:35,859
Salvation?

401
00:32:36,686 --> 00:32:37,787
The professor;

402
00:32:37,907 --> 00:32:40,107
The one who made a chess mat

403
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:44,409
the Police, the National Intelligence Center and the Special Bodies?

404
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:48,377
The man I was talking to on the phone for five days?

405
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:51,080
I told him

406
00:32:51,568 --> 00:32:55,146
what clothes I wore, and what kind of orgasms I had.

407
00:32:57,554 --> 00:32:59,204
Which of them are you?

408
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,630
Why are not your footprints in the National Database?

409
00:33:12,998 --> 00:33:16,548
I had to renew my identity before digitizing them.

410
00:33:18,782 --> 00:33:20,132
When did you get it?

411
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,758
It's been over 20 years.

412
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:36,044
That gives you plenty of possibilities, right?

413
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,582
Why nobody will denounce someone's disappearance

414
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:42,855
which simply does not exist.

415
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,320
Which means I will not even need to burn your body well.

416
00:33:53,236 --> 00:33:54,532
You want this;

417
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:58,919
Kill me and burn me?

418
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,607
Yes.

419
00:34:03,616 --> 00:34:05,194
I certify you yes.

420
00:34:07,374 --> 00:34:08,397
Look

421
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,720
perhaps as an Inspector

422
00:34:12,312 --> 00:34:14,007
I should not have said that

423
00:34:14,127 --> 00:34:17,877
to the person who organized the robbery at the National Mint.

424
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,320
But as a woman

425
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:27,084
as a woman who spent years scaring everyone

426
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:29,182
everything

427
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,904
and who trusted someone

428
00:34:32,024 --> 00:34:35,324
someone who knew how fragile and vulnerable they were

429
00:34:35,803 --> 00:34:39,853
and yet she was beating her from the beginning, from the first moment

430
00:34:40,321 --> 00:34:43,411
I do not think it is so absurd, right?

431
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,387
You could

432
00:34:46,913 --> 00:34:48,663
to have approached me

433
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,320
to fish me

434
00:34:51,037 --> 00:34:54,549
give me a microphone, fuck me!

435
00:34:55,436 --> 00:34:57,784
But no. Slowly!

436
00:34:59,118 --> 00:35:01,183
Yesterday we had dreams together.

437
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:04,202
Fuck!

438
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,657
We were talking about the future. For the future!

439
00:35:10,822 --> 00:35:12,380
Who the hell are you?

440
00:35:12,781 --> 00:35:15,180
What are you; An old-timer?

441
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,980
It was all designed, Rachel.

442
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,846
All. Everything.

443
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,100
I'm so sorry. It was all designed

444
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,209
except what happened between us.

445
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:33,009
- I do not know, it missed me. - What;

446
00:35:33,129 --> 00:35:36,906
- I did not calculate this variable. - What the hell are you saying?

447
00:35:37,197 --> 00:35:39,647
- What variable? - To fall in love with you.

448
00:35:42,445 --> 00:35:46,095
Seriously, I think I'll let you continue the same violin

449
00:35:46,247 --> 00:35:47,497
old man?

450
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:51,420
That I will be stingy while you are mocking me

451
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,490
- like I'm fifteen years old? - I'm not lying to you, Rachel.

452
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,643
I've fallen in love with you.

453
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:04,246
Tell me again. Come on again. Dare to get it back.

454
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,051
Rachel

455
00:36:07,419 --> 00:36:09,024
I've fallen in love with you.

456
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,002
I'm so sorry.

457
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:32,226
Very well.

458
00:36:33,356 --> 00:36:34,577
Very well.

459
00:37:31,677 --> 00:37:34,700
17:46 THE TIME

460
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:54,211
Berlin, I want to talk to you.

461
00:37:55,195 --> 00:37:57,820
Of course. I am again a leader.

462
00:37:58,816 --> 00:38:01,216
I need food for my puppies.

463
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:04,143
What the Professor said exactly to you

464
00:38:04,263 --> 00:38:05,671
for Tokyo?

465
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,660
He told me he would try to free her.

466
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,180
And how will he release it on his own?

467
00:38:14,955 --> 00:38:16,100
Rio

468
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,910
he will not do it.

469
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,241
Who, then?

470
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,740
The four Serbs who finished the tunnel five years ago.

471
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,467
It's "wild" for extreme cases.

472
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,850
- When will it be done; - I do not know.

473
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,960
You feel her absence, right?

474
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,310
For those who stay behind is harder.

475
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,548
She, on the contrary, will expand

476
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,840
her experiences

477
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,860
satisfying her wishes

478
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,367
will have fun.

479
00:38:58,215 --> 00:39:01,315
Would you like to accept the deal with the Police?

480
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:02,783
Completely.

481
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,890
What if we walked out of here?

482
00:39:06,454 --> 00:39:07,904
Would we go on together?

483
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,944
- You mean to betray your friends. - My friends with city names?

484
00:39:14,463 --> 00:39:16,613
Tokyo, Berlin, Moscow, Denver.

485
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,877
My friends with city names look great to me.

486
00:39:21,997 --> 00:39:23,447
And I'll tell you something.

487
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:26,217
Look at hiding if you accept the deal.

488
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,730
Because if I see you, I'll throw you in the temple.

489
00:39:31,091 --> 00:39:35,291
Women always turn the page first. Look at being prepared.

490
00:39:39,106 --> 00:39:40,906
Tokyo is impulsive

491
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,110
but he will turn

492
00:39:43,663 --> 00:39:45,428
and we will be together.

493
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,116
I know.

494
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,898
Of course!

495
00:39:51,966 --> 00:39:53,196
For sure.

496
00:39:56,717 --> 00:39:58,717
I have always believed the same thing.

497
00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:19,974
If you betray us and you leave

498
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,920
and you want to take me when you regret

499
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,300
because you believe me

500
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,570
you will regret this

501
00:40:32,538 --> 00:40:34,775
you can call your cell phone.

502
00:40:34,895 --> 00:40:36,421
I will have it open.

503
00:40:38,421 --> 00:40:41,639
The police will hear us, but it will not matter anymore.

504
00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:52,676
ALISSON PARKER

505
00:41:02,798 --> 00:41:05,820
Suarett, she opened her cell phone Lisin Parker.

506
00:41:08,286 --> 00:41:11,586
- Try to hurt it. - The camera is covered.

507
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,460
They do not call or send anything.

508
00:41:46,443 --> 00:41:48,849
What the fuck is going on? My horn!

509
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:51,799
<i> A prisoner transport unit here! </ i> We are attacking!

510
00:41:51,919 --> 00:41:55,620
<i> Here Centrally. I do not get you clean. Repeat, please. </ I>

511
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,538
- We have interference. - My horn inside!

512
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,407
<i> My guardian angel had not forsaken me. </ i>

513
00:42:01,527 --> 00:42:04,577
<i> And I felt like I was in the train of horror. </ i>

514
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,580
It's a bomb!

515
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,220
- What's going on in there? - They've put us in a bomb!

516
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,491
<i> In a dark tunnel where you do not know where the skeleton will be thrown away. </ i>

517
00:42:12,611 --> 00:42:14,385
- We're losers! - Shut up!

518
00:42:14,505 --> 00:42:15,980
<i> But how fun! </ i>

519
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,460
What happened; What the fuck is going on?

520
00:42:19,868 --> 00:42:21,976
- Damn, they're killing us! - Stop!

521
00:42:22,096 --> 00:42:25,058
- We're losers! - Shut up! I'm trying to think!

522
00:42:34,392 --> 00:42:35,397
Outside!

523
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,600
OK OK! Non!

524
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,966
Download the weapons, otherwise I shoot.

525
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:26,880
Download the weapons, otherwise I shoot.

526
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,695
If you shoot a girl, you are dying.

527
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,651
If you shoot me

528
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,600
you are dying.

529
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,787
If you leave a girl, you live.

530
00:43:38,493 --> 00:43:41,893
<i> I wish all the decisions in the world were so easy. </ i>

531
00:43:42,248 --> 00:43:43,337
<i> Right? </ i>

532
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,534
Rio.

533
00:44:03,136 --> 00:44:04,179
Rio!

534
00:44:07,634 --> 00:44:11,134
Before, I realized that you did not agree with what Helsinki did.

535
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,297
You are not like them.

536
00:44:17,736 --> 00:44:19,220
You are a good guy.

537
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,545
You know, I have a son in your age.

538
00:44:26,759 --> 00:44:27,980
The big one.

539
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,700
And he's a good kid.

540
00:44:34,877 --> 00:44:36,660
Help me please.

541
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,621
I want to see my son.

542
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:08,260
I found the passport machine.

543
00:45:08,978 --> 00:45:11,085
- No no. - Monica.

544
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,653
'fuck me.

545
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:17,379
You can do whatever you want.

546
00:45:18,111 --> 00:45:19,867
But, if you change your mind?

547
00:45:20,082 --> 00:45:23,082
I thought it would be good to have a new one.

548
00:45:23,391 --> 00:45:26,337
- That's good stuff. - I know it, I work here.

549
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,522
- You'll like it, let's do it. - No.

550
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:31,762
If you do not want it, go for it, burn it, whatever you want.

551
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,200
Two minutes will take us only.

552
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,640
- We do it; - Yes, okay.

553
00:45:38,382 --> 00:45:39,982
- Did you connect it? - Yeah.

554
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,292
Okay.

555
00:45:41,798 --> 00:45:43,540
What name should I put?

556
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,880
- '' fuck ''. - '' gatha '';

557
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,120
- What's up; - Sounds like a porn star.

558
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,001
The "gatha" is very beautiful.

559
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:57,498
If you were ugly, I would tell you to put "Fenissa" or "Marie-Krouth".

560
00:45:57,618 --> 00:45:59,940
- "Maria Fernandez." - "Maria Fernandez"?

561
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,561
Very trivial. You will not believe it. 'oh me, I know of them.

562
00:46:03,681 --> 00:46:06,295
- It's more discreet. - '' Ghatah '' sounds a trifle.

563
00:46:06,415 --> 00:46:07,880
Put it on.

564
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,700
- Here you go. - Thanks.

565
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,920
He was born in Madrid

566
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,450
and the date you want.

567
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,681
- We're making a passport. - Indeed.

568
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:30,590
Did he eventually pop it?

569
00:46:31,863 --> 00:46:33,460
or come with us.

570
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:38,940
Who do you think he got your gun?

571
00:46:45,588 --> 00:46:46,790
Come outside.

572
00:46:54,498 --> 00:46:55,574
<i> Suareth. </ i>

573
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,493
<i> I invite you from the Supreme Court. </ i>

574
00:46:58,613 --> 00:47:00,833
<i> The conveyor that carried Silene Oliveira </ i>

575
00:47:00,953 --> 00:47:05,194
<i> had to be here for 15 minutes and has not arrived. We have no news. </ I>

576
00:47:05,314 --> 00:47:06,809
Keep me up to date.

577
00:47:07,336 --> 00:47:08,350
Gomet?

578
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:11,506
Two units to make Oliveira's route to the court.

579
00:47:11,626 --> 00:47:13,727
They have not arrived yet. I want to know what's running.

580
00:47:13,847 --> 00:47:15,004
Understandable.

581
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,339
Wear it.

582
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,875
Unique Contact Professor.

583
00:48:11,344 --> 00:48:12,874
That's what you're doing.

584
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:54,932
<i> I had never felt so free. </ i>

585
00:48:57,658 --> 00:49:01,208
<i> But that time, the Professor's plan would not work. </ i>

586
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,560
I know that pressure has come from me.

587
00:49:19,419 --> 00:49:20,968
That I was wrong

588
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,220
but, please

589
00:49:25,598 --> 00:49:27,348
I do not deserve that.

590
00:49:29,908 --> 00:49:31,280
Please

591
00:49:32,047 --> 00:49:33,483
I am asking you

592
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:36,430
if you have a little dignity.

593
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,457
I can not breathe.

594
00:49:38,761 --> 00:49:40,961
I can not breathe, help me.

595
00:49:41,277 --> 00:49:43,524
Help me please.

596
00:49:43,857 --> 00:49:45,077
We are entering

597
00:49:50,448 --> 00:49:52,700
we get food and we sit.

598
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,528
One measure from each other. Come on, let's go!

599
00:50:02,593 --> 00:50:04,380
That's what it is.

600
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:06,380
In a row. Helsinki

601
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,270
say hello to Arturite. Aruritus?

602
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,280
There is something that does not make sense.

603
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,701
Before they said that if I was going to be shaking in the air

604
00:50:25,821 --> 00:50:27,599
but they have me here.

605
00:50:28,374 --> 00:50:31,472
With this unbearable heat. It makes a terrible heat!

606
00:50:31,592 --> 00:50:34,729
It is best to be calm and silent.

607
00:50:34,849 --> 00:50:36,619
- It does not make sense. - What thing;

608
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:38,620
The bomb has no logic.

609
00:50:39,634 --> 00:50:42,076
You think she would risk sweating it

610
00:50:42,196 --> 00:50:44,896
and to shake the whole pattern in the air?

611
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,157
No. It would be madness.

612
00:50:49,486 --> 00:50:51,599
- They do not work like this. - Stuck!

613
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:54,414
They're making a psychological war, you do not understand?

614
00:50:54,534 --> 00:50:58,359
They are trying to terrify us. This is fake, a bluff.

615
00:50:58,479 --> 00:51:01,074
I do not know and do not want to know. So you smell!

616
00:51:01,194 --> 00:51:04,389
I'll take it out, I decided. I'll get it out, I can not do more.

617
00:51:05,169 --> 00:51:08,839
There will be nothing. If it was to explode, they would not have put us all together.

618
00:51:08,959 --> 00:51:11,135
- Stay calm and sit down. - Who are you

619
00:51:11,255 --> 00:51:13,805
what will you tell us what to do?

620
00:51:14,268 --> 00:51:17,718
Especially you, because we are locked in here!

621
00:51:23,058 --> 00:51:25,540
- Because of me; - Yeah, because of you.

622
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,901
You are Director here

623
00:51:28,021 --> 00:51:31,316
and eight madmen came in as if they were home.

624
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:35,141
Is there another Mint in the world who robbed you?

625
00:51:35,261 --> 00:51:36,783
Only that, right?

626
00:51:39,975 --> 00:51:41,294
Congratulations.

627
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,483
You wrote a story.

628
00:51:44,155 --> 00:51:47,305
Now, please, do not let it blow in the air

629
00:51:47,425 --> 00:51:49,080
and sit down!

630
00:51:52,105 --> 00:51:53,129
Have a seat!

631
00:52:05,604 --> 00:52:08,104
<i> Center, are you receiving me? The van was hit. </ I>

632
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,730
- <i> No trace of Oliveira. </ i> - Received. Wait for instructions.

633
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,219
Caution! We have one fugitive.

634
00:52:15,339 --> 00:52:17,789
We are activating the Cage business!

635
00:52:43,781 --> 00:52:45,120
<i> It was not there. </ i>

636
00:52:46,362 --> 00:52:47,601
<i> It was not. </ i>

637
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,546
<i> It had organized them all. </ i>

638
00:52:50,912 --> 00:52:52,762
<i> He had sent to save me. </ i>

639
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,028
<i> How could it not be there? </ i>

640
00:52:55,148 --> 00:52:57,866
<i> That afternoon of October, they applied for my flight </ i>

641
00:52:57,986 --> 00:53:01,428
<i> the Cage business. It happens when there are attacks. </ I>

642
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:05,015
<i> The police "cut off" all the city's exits. </ i>

643
00:53:05,231 --> 00:53:07,857
<i> Everything paralyzes and you are trapped. </ i>

644
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:09,707
<i> You can only hide. </ i>

645
00:53:09,827 --> 00:53:12,477
<i> The problem was that the hiding place was the warehouse </ i>

646
00:53:12,597 --> 00:53:15,497
<i> And the one who would open me was the Professor. </ i>

647
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,960
<i> And I've never done it well with the wait. </ i>

648
00:54:02,941 --> 00:54:04,246
What is that?

649
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:09,640
The only truth I know about you is that you are a professional liar.

650
00:54:11,664 --> 00:54:14,857
Tell me paranoid, but you will not lie to me again.

651
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,669
I assure you.

652
00:54:21,746 --> 00:54:24,885
Do you think I do not know? That I'm a mole?

653
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,408
Of course, he took that weapon.

654
00:54:27,528 --> 00:54:31,322
She regretted it, but if not, I would now be with Oslo.

655
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:33,488
Okay, hello, let's get it right.

656
00:54:33,608 --> 00:54:36,473
But do not make a passport and get it.

657
00:54:36,593 --> 00:54:37,957
And if I want that?

658
00:54:38,077 --> 00:54:41,092
And if I want to live with her and take her child?

659
00:54:41,212 --> 00:54:44,811
You have enough of your own problems to take over the other.

660
00:54:44,931 --> 00:54:48,860
She is a girl who loves me and her child is not to blame.

661
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,409
- You do not have to get involved. - I mean, because I want it.

662
00:54:52,529 --> 00:54:56,137
It's times we're going to help somebody, but we're diving first.

663
00:54:56,257 --> 00:54:58,522
If I swim, I swim as I did a lifetime.

664
00:54:58,642 --> 00:55:02,042
It's not that simple, damn it! He has lived firsthand.

665
00:55:04,084 --> 00:55:07,134
All my life I was trying to help your mother.

666
00:55:12,177 --> 00:55:14,017
Where does this hang now?

667
00:55:15,618 --> 00:55:17,460
Mom left us.

668
00:55:17,888 --> 00:55:19,991
What does this mean now?

669
00:55:24,902 --> 00:55:26,602
We abandoned it.

670
00:55:28,105 --> 00:55:30,462
Why would he pull us into the abyss.

671
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,760
I put her in a clinic in Barcelona.

672
00:55:37,013 --> 00:55:39,041
It cost me 200,000 pesetas.

673
00:55:39,623 --> 00:55:42,373
And within 24 hours he came to my pension

674
00:55:42,752 --> 00:55:45,652
- badly made with heroin. - What did you do;

675
00:55:46,111 --> 00:55:47,791
It was the fourth time

676
00:55:48,586 --> 00:55:52,004
- I lost my savings. - What the hell did you do?

677
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,930
She wanted to go buy something else.

678
00:55:59,044 --> 00:56:00,760
I put her in the car

679
00:56:01,386 --> 00:56:03,631
and I left it in a square

680
00:56:03,904 --> 00:56:06,695
near a settlement where they sold heroin.

681
00:56:11,072 --> 00:56:12,610
I did not expect it.

682
00:56:13,229 --> 00:56:14,685
I came to find you

683
00:56:16,745 --> 00:56:18,201
To leave.

684
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:23,153
Have you left my mother in a square?

685
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:31,755
That's why I put you in this bay.

686
00:56:32,046 --> 00:56:34,065
Not to live the life I've lived.

687
00:56:34,185 --> 00:56:36,515
Because I want you to be free, I want you to start

688
00:56:36,635 --> 00:56:38,833
A mother does not give up!

689
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,345
Help her get deaconated!

690
00:56:42,373 --> 00:56:45,573
All my life made me think she was a bastard!

691
00:56:46,138 --> 00:56:48,688
I thought he might have left because of me!

692
00:56:52,957 --> 00:56:54,591
It was her or we.

693
00:57:01,471 --> 00:57:05,371
I do not break your head because we need you to get out of here.

694
00:57:06,185 --> 00:57:07,621
When we get out

695
00:57:08,048 --> 00:57:09,748
we will be two strangers.

696
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,930
Two strangers.

697
00:57:12,623 --> 00:57:13,843
Denver

698
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,656
and Moscow.

699
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,213
Did you even finish your passport?

700
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:51,005
Yes.

701
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,524
Denver, are you okay?

702
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,893
I put the '' goat ''.

703
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:30,151
<i> I was driving at frenzied speed nowhere. </ i>

704
00:58:58,049 --> 00:59:00,899
<i> In a fraction of a second I knew where to go. </ i>

705
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,581
<i> The bad was </ i>

706
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:06,463
<i> that it was the most guarded part of the country. </ i>

707
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,852
Take a deep breath.

708
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,849
Do you have anxiety?

709
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,080
No, I am fine.

710
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,154
Do you see those lines?

711
00:59:59,635 --> 01:00:03,344
Each lie will translate into ugly curves.

712
01:00:05,147 --> 01:00:07,697
Due to a blood pressure disorder

713
01:00:07,832 --> 01:00:11,232
heart rate and respiratory rate.

714
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:14,969
Do not lie to me, then, because I will know it.

715
01:00:19,539 --> 01:00:20,689
Name.

716
01:00:22,342 --> 01:00:23,863
Sergio Marcina.

717
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,092
Place of birth.

718
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,660
San Sebastian.

719
01:00:35,846 --> 01:00:38,196
Did you know that you would destroy the nell?

720
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:45,875
Yes.

721
01:00:50,827 --> 01:00:53,587
You caused his accident?

722
01:00:54,382 --> 01:00:55,396
No.

723
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,520
Was your idea of ​​robbery in the Mint?

724
01:01:04,858 --> 01:01:05,858
No.

725
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,993
Who thought it?

726
01:01:13,976 --> 01:01:15,263
My father.

727
01:01:16,746 --> 01:01:20,046
He died before he realized it, so it's like a tribute.

728
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:27,170
The story of the damned apples.

729
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,610
The history of organic cider

730
01:01:31,807 --> 01:01:33,680
you told me yesterday in bed

731
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,900
was the story of robbery.

732
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,612
And I was listening to you like stupid.

733
01:01:39,959 --> 01:01:43,187
You were laughing at me from the beginning. From the first moment!

734
01:01:43,307 --> 01:01:47,007
I did not laugh with you, Rachel. Look, please, the polygraph.

735
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,977
Look at him.

736
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:55,692
My father had a sick son

737
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:58,320
and not even a fivefold knocker.

738
01:01:59,696 --> 01:02:01,264
What would you do;

739
01:02:03,588 --> 01:02:05,719
All day he was thinking of robberies

740
01:02:07,255 --> 01:02:09,955
to pay a hospital in the US.

741
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,067
From despair.

742
01:02:14,751 --> 01:02:16,619
To save my life.

743
01:02:17,854 --> 01:02:18,981
Me

744
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:23,380
because nobody

745
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,451
you do

746
01:02:28,066 --> 01:02:29,568
he did not help him.

747
01:02:32,567 --> 01:02:35,717
And in this endeavor, they threw it with bullets.

748
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:38,729
In the entrance

749
01:02:40,098 --> 01:02:41,648
of a bank.

750
01:02:44,557 --> 01:02:46,595
This is the reality.

751
01:02:50,626 --> 01:02:54,226
I guess there are many ways to judge what's right.

752
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:58,810
Have you considered me easy prey because I was a battered woman?

753
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:08,617
Yes, I thought so.

754
01:03:11,677 --> 01:03:13,686
When you leaked to the press

755
01:03:14,345 --> 01:03:18,500
my refusal to release eleven hostages instead of Lisa Parker

756
01:03:18,698 --> 01:03:21,075
you knew that they would publicly "lynch" me

757
01:03:21,195 --> 01:03:25,695
that my career would be destroyed and that my mother, my daughter, would see it.

758
01:03:26,116 --> 01:03:27,158
Yes.

759
01:03:29,462 --> 01:03:31,030
I do. And

760
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:36,470
you slept with me just because I'm the head of the case, right?

761
01:03:37,373 --> 01:03:40,323
- You slept with me just for this. - No no.

762
01:03:40,521 --> 01:03:43,199
- Stop lying, fuck! - I am not lying to you.

763
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:45,421
Do you want to believe that you feel something about me?

764
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:48,641
I do not want you to believe anything. It's what I feel.

765
01:03:49,543 --> 01:03:50,999
Not expecting

766
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,840
but it happened to me. The same to you.

767
01:03:56,446 --> 01:03:59,146
It happened to you, otherwise, what are we doing here?

768
01:04:03,751 --> 01:04:07,051
Why am I not in the detention center? What good does that mean?

769
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,172
I'm not crazy, Rachel. It is something that happens to both of us.

770
01:04:12,292 --> 01:04:15,592
In both, do you understand? It happened to us both.

771
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,421
Yes, Suareth.

772
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:27,399
<i> Inspector, Silene Oliveira escaped. </ i>

773
01:04:28,305 --> 01:04:30,173
- What; - <i> Going to court. </ i>

774
01:04:30,293 --> 01:04:32,878
<i> He asked to file with the Investigator. </ i> The convoy was hit

775
01:04:32,998 --> 01:04:36,252
from a group of people from eastern countries. I activated the "Cage".

776
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:40,120
- I hope they have not come out of Madrid. - <i> Go straight to the Investigator. </ i>

777
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,448
To issue an international arrest warrant.

778
01:04:42,568 --> 01:04:45,951
Track national roads, harbors and airports.

779
01:04:46,071 --> 01:04:48,171
Get patrolled at the border.

780
01:04:58,604 --> 01:05:00,162
Tokyo escaped.

781
01:05:02,186 --> 01:05:03,386
You did it;

782
01:05:03,576 --> 01:05:07,716
Did you get a killer from a high security prison while I'm holding you here?

783
01:05:14,925 --> 01:05:18,240
I had prepared everything before we went to the café.

784
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:31,540
I'm sorry for the reception, but I just came back.

785
01:05:34,334 --> 01:05:36,884
Darko, I'm so sorry for your brother.

786
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:43,723
Come in.

787
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,037
You've all thought about it with millimeter accuracy, right?

788
01:05:51,157 --> 01:05:52,846
Rachel, I told you everything.

789
01:05:58,439 --> 01:06:00,978
I came here without showing resistance.

790
01:06:03,254 --> 01:06:05,728
And if I let you interrogate me

791
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,223
is why

792
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,925
I wanted to be honest with you. I can not stand this lie any longer.

793
01:06:13,045 --> 01:06:14,047
Stop it.

794
01:06:14,167 --> 01:06:17,142
I do not want to hurt you anymore. It is a great relief

795
01:06:17,262 --> 01:06:19,395
Laugh, finally, fuck!

796
01:06:20,288 --> 01:06:22,384
I have no intention of hearing you again!

797
01:06:22,504 --> 01:06:23,531
'k

798
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:28,290
from now on, whatever you are saying, you will tell the Investigator directly.

799
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:31,726
Get up.

800
01:06:34,222 --> 01:06:35,865
Get up, get it!

801
01:06:36,995 --> 01:06:38,469
Move on.

802
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,013
Move on!

803
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:47,859
Keep walking.

804
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,870
- I'm so sorry, Rachel. - He continued

805
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,405
I'll shoot!

806
01:06:58,710 --> 01:06:59,715
It will

807
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:25,930
<i> Have you heard the phrase "Am I in the mouth of the wolf?" </ i>

808
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,660
A call is made to her cell phone.

809
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:40,042
From an unknown number. Identify it.

810
01:07:51,019 --> 01:07:52,371
- Yes? - Rio?

811
01:07:53,848 --> 01:07:55,201
I'm Tokyo.

812
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,960
- <i> Is Silene Oliveira. </ i> - Write!

813
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,222
- Find the call! - Where are you;

814
01:08:01,342 --> 01:08:03,560
Wait! <i> They're listening to us. </ i>

815
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,575
I do not care.

816
01:08:06,069 --> 01:08:10,019
It's an erotic phone call. <i> And the police are crazy for love. </ i>

817
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:12,890
<i> 'fuck me. </ i>

818
01:08:13,934 --> 01:08:17,484
Do you remember the door that my mom made me when I was afraid? </ I>

819
01:08:17,953 --> 01:08:19,573
Which door is talking about?

820
01:08:19,746 --> 01:08:21,833
<i> Yes, my love, </ i> and of course I remember it.

821
01:08:21,953 --> 01:08:24,203
- What happens; - I'll pass it.

822
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:27,330
<i> I will pass the door of the sky. </ i>

823
01:08:27,488 --> 01:08:30,238
Why does my guardian angel do not appear.

824
01:08:33,812 --> 01:08:35,136
One minute.

825
01:08:38,974 --> 01:08:40,115
I love you.

826
01:08:40,472 --> 01:08:42,012
I love you too.

827
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:01,270
What was this phone call?

828
01:09:01,819 --> 01:09:03,603
It looked like farewell.

829
01:09:19,427 --> 01:09:22,103
<i> Gentlemen, be careful. Unauthorized vehicle on the perimeter. </ I>

830
01:09:22,223 --> 01:09:23,565
Lets go, lets go!

831
01:09:30,189 --> 01:09:32,536
- You! Stand up! - That's it!

832
01:09:33,016 --> 01:09:34,068
Door

833
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:36,540
He will pass the door

834
01:09:37,713 --> 01:09:39,150
Damn, the door!

835
01:09:41,441 --> 01:09:43,060
You. Stand up.

836
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,403
Caution! It's Silene Oliveira!

837
01:09:50,501 --> 01:09:52,134
Tokyo is coming!

838
01:09:53,869 --> 01:09:55,287
Tokyo is coming!

839
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,360
Below! Everybody on the floor!

840
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,530
We have to open the door!

841
01:10:00,272 --> 01:10:03,522
Shoot the target! Shoot the motorcyclist!

842
01:10:08,429 --> 01:10:09,462
Let's go!

843
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:19,796
No! We have to cover it!

844
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,390
<i> We have a bandit in sight. </ i>

845
01:10:24,327 --> 01:10:25,726
Dad, watch!

846
01:10:27,766 --> 01:10:30,254
Beware, behind you! Back to you!

847
01:11:19,133 --> 01:11:20,232
Fuck!

848
01:11:20,979 --> 01:11:22,144
Fuck!

849
01:11:54,636 --> 01:11:55,753
Moscow!

850
01:11:56,086 --> 01:11:57,147
Moscow!

01:12:24,945 --> 01:12:28,945

852
01:12:29,654 --> 01:12:33,654

<b> THE NEXT EPISODE </ b>
