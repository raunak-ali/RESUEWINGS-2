1
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,400
SUNDAY
11:40 PM

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,520
"Why didn’t you call me, huh?"

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,520
Why?

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,840
"Where the heck were you?"

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,400
Where the heck?

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,800
62 HOURS OF ROBBERY

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,440
Wounded man! Wounded man! Help me!

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,440
"What happened?"

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,400
Helsinki, what happened?

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,640
Hostages, escape.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,160
Strong whack, brain injury.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,640
Denver, did you know about the escape?

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,720
Which hostage did the escape?

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,840
Which hostage did the escape?

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,480
Arturo. He told me, but I...

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,480
didn’t get there in time.

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,680
Arturo.

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,320
Helsinki.

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,680
Helsinki.

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,480
Oslo is not well.

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,800
No.

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,520
He’s badly injured.

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,120
No, no.

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,120
Not badly injured.

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,000
Not badly injured.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,480
He just needs rest and medicine.

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,360
Time for medicine.

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,680
-Why has he got his eyes opened?
-I, now give medicine.

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,520
Anti-inflammatories

30
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,000
and heparin.

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,480
And go to sleep.

32
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,840
And tomorrow, Oslo better.

33
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,600
Moscow, you don’t worry.

34
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,360
Oslo and I have had
worst colds than this one.

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,080
Worst colds.

36
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,360
"Oslo’s eyes never twinkled,

37
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,800
but now it was how we looked all of us,
sad and absent.

38
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,840
Hope is like dominoes,

39
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,120
once one falls, the others follow.

40
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,040
And the hostages noticed we were fucked."

41
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,120
Last night we heard the shots.

42
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,320
Anyone injured?

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,480
I won’t shut my mouth.

44
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,440
-Sit down.
-One of my pupils is missing,

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,000
Pablo Ruiz,
and I want to know where he is.

46
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,560
Sit down.

47
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,840
I said sit down!

48
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,760
Your pupil escaped
with a group of hostages.

49
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,640
They blew up a charge and fled.

50
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,400
You don’t have to worry about anyone.

51
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,720
They’re all fine.

52
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,720
What’s that freak doing?

53
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,240
Madam, sit down
and stop clapping your hands.

54
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,520
Sit down.

55
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,520
Sit down, now!

56
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,920
Madam, sit down.

57
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,680
To the ground.

58
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
To the ground!

59
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,440
For fuck’s sake,
everyone to the ground, damn!

60
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,600
To the ground!

61
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,480
Sit down!

62
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,840
Fucking hell, to the ground!

63
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,360
Make them stop.

64
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,640
Stop!

65
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,600
Stop!

66
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,000
I said, stop!

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,640
Everyone sit down.

68
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,760
Sit down.

69
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,560
Sit down, please.

70
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,720
Well, look.

71
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
No, Moscow.

72
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,520
-What?
-First, open eyes.

73
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,560
Look where shoot.

74
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,960
Hold gun.

75
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,280
Relax elbow.

76
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,880
-But, you wear thongs, don’t you?
-I’m not going to wear knickers.

77
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
-I’m not wearing, I left it at home.
-No.

78
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,560
Then neither will I.

79
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,000
-With a bare cock you rob.
-Don’t’ be dirty-minded.

80
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,520
-Bare cock.
-The hostages...

81
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,200
Quiet.

82
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,240
What’s the matter?

83
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,800
As time progresses
the hostages will stop being compliant.

84
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,320
When they see there are no releases,
that there isn’t any progress,

85
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,000
their survival instinct
will make them do something.

86
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,960
And what will they do?

87
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,680
The Numismatics people will do
like de Bruce Willis?

88
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,400
Something of that sort, Nairobi.

89
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
They’ll try to escape.

90
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,240
Or they’ll escape.

91
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,720
-No.
-That’s possible, it can happen.

92
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,920
We’re armed.

93
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,560
At that point, the other hostages
will stop fearing us.

94
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,080
If that happens, it’s extremely important
to regain control and, in that case,

95
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,240
we’ll do it using empathy,

96
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,360
creating an atmosphere

97
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,120
of much more solid trust than the one
we’ve had until to that moment.

98
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Trust and M-16,
don’t go together, do they?

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,560
Then we’ll have to find things
that bring us closer to the hostages.

100
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,440
Let’s see.

101
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,040
What unites people, huh?

102
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,080
Football.

103
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,680
Football is a good example.

104
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,760
But there’s something
that unites people ever more

105
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,440
than football.

106
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,160
Sex?

107
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,600
Yes, sex brings people together,
but in couples.

108
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,720
-Or not.
-Careful.

109
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,840
Usually.

110
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,040
There’s... There are, well...

111
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,720
There are threesomes and even foursomes

112
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,560
-and even structures of group.
-Structures?

113
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,200
But it goes without saying
that there’s no room for that

114
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,320
-in our plan.
-Ay, sorry, guys.

115
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,280
Thank goodness.

116
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,760
With my luck, if we organize an orgy,

117
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,440
I’m sure I’ll have this one behind.

118
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,120
But, Professor,

119
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,760
what unites more than sex?

120
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,000
What unites us?

121
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,200
All of us, I mean.

122
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,400
Well, I’ve become very fond
of you all, but, honestly,

123
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,720
money.

124
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,440
Money.

125
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,320
And we might not have other things,
but we’ll have loads of money.

126
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,360
I’ve been giving it a lot of thought

127
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,960
about how to turn our hostages

128
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,040
into our business partners.

129
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,800
And, well, I’ve come to the conclusion.

130
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,720
Money

131
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,400
or freedom.

132
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,280
Have you ever thought,
I mean like in fantasy,

133
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,960
of putting price to yourself?

134
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,120
I’m telling you I'm in.

135
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,480
Think it over, Mr Torres,
you’ve got two hours.

136
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,920
I have nothing to think over.

137
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,960
I’m talking about the pain,
the pain we’re causing you.

138
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,480
I’m working here better
than I’ve ever worked in my whole life.

139
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
What would be a hostage’s minimum salary?

140
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,920
I thought of a million euros,
Just like that, tax free.

141
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,240
You won’t fool me.

142
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,320
-I know perfectly how this works.
-Really?

143
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,040
You know how hard it is,
and you know that your profession

144
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,920
is something that’s in your blood.

145
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,680
I’ve never had a boss like you,
Ms Nairobi.

146
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,720
It's that or the second option.

147
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,800
-Which is the second option?
-Leave just like that, with nothing.

148
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,760
Like I’m telling you, but empty handed.

149
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,360
How will we get
a million euros out of here?

150
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,080
Hidden inside our underwear?

151
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,800
You give me the address
of a first cousin’s of yours, a friend,

152
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,640
and I’ll make sure you receive an envelope
with your money in five, or six months

153
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,440
-after getting out of here.
-Think it over.

154
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,240
It’s different to raise a son
with a million under your mattress.

155
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,400
So...

156
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,480
Freedom

157
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,720
or the money.

158
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,360
One million.

159
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,440
There was a camera,

160
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,000
at the toilets entrance.

161
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,360
And in this corridor
I think there was another one.

162
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,800
So you say that apart from the building
cameras, they installed some more.

163
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,680
Yes, those ones were different.

164
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,920
We were digging a tunnel for them.

165
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,240
It was in the basement.

166
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,080
There was a lot of ammunition.

167
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,200
Enough for a war,
there were boxes full of bullets,

168
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,320
chargers, explosives.

169
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,840
Yes, these three were part of the gang.

170
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,760
They were eight, two of them foreigners.

171
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,280
Could you say if any of them
was the Professor?

172
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,720
Their names were city names.

173
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,120
Berlin.

174
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,920
-Moscow.
-Denver.

175
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,960
-Nairobi.
-Helsinki.

176
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,800
-She is Tokyo.
-This one was Rio.

177
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,680
He was the least dangerous of them.

178
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,320
He was watching Alison.

179
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,520
Was Alison in a different place
from the rest of the hostages?

180
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,160
Yes, sometimes she was taken apart.

181
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,360
One of the foreigners is injured

182
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,280
or dead.

183
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,880
We hit him on the head with a pipe.

184
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,720
Oslo was his name.

185
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,840
If you’ll excuse me, you can have a rest.

186
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,840
You may have a coffee or something to eat.

187
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,480
-Okay.
-Lobo, escort him outside.

188
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,560
Have a sit.

189
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,600
These are Ángel’s glasses.

190
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,680
They inserted a microphone in them,
a Keylock 20-10

191
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,320
with an audio range of 1,500 metres.

192
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,840
They must have done it
when he went in with the paramedics.

193
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,040
Ángel is not a traitor.

194
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,000
Raquel.

195
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,520
I know what’s crossing
your mind right now.

196
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,880
But you were just doing your job.
Any of us would have done the same.

197
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,960
All the evidence pointed at him.

198
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,280
I was also wrong.

199
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,640
THE SECOND IN CHARGE
OF THE HEIST CRISIS

200
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,360
OF THE FÁBRICA DE MONEDA Y TIMBRE

201
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,640
IN COMMA AFTER HAVING
A CAR ACCIDENT

202
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,520
"You have a new message.

203
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,480
Raquel, it’s me again.
Phone me, your voice mailbox is full.

204
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,240
We have him, listen, we have him.

205
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,000
We have the guy
who is helping them from outside.

206
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,840
Yes, it’s Salva, Salva.
Salva, the one that makes cider.

207
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,720
He was in the wreck yard.
He threatened the Russian guy.

208
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,920
For heaven’s sake, he’s using you, damn.
His fingerprints are in the patrol car.

209
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,520
He’s got closer to you
to learn about the investigation.

210
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,480
He’s using you.

211
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,000
To return the phone call press...."

212
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,040
"Hello, it’s Raquel.
I can answer you right now.

213
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,800
If it’s urgent,
leave your message after the beep."

214
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,760
"The voice mailbox of the number
you have dialled is full."

215
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,680
Ángel was phoning me all evening,

216
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,680
But I didn’t pick up his phone calls.

217
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,920
Sixteen phone calls.

218
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,480
He phoned me 16 times.

219
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,200
And I didn’t answer the phone.

220
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,360
"Raquel.

221
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,400
Raquel, it’s Ángel.

222
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,400
Listen to me,
I’m asking you to reconsider.

223
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,000
Look, I can understand your rage.

224
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,520
-I’ve also...."
-Unplug the loudspeaker or turn it down.

225
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,560
"...the first row we’ve had.
I must be an asshole

226
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,560
or whatever you say,"

227
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,520
but I’m not the mole.

228
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,240
I’m not the mole, for heaven’s sake.

229
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,200
"You’ll ruin my life, Raquel.

230
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,200
Phone me.

231
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,080
Raquel."

232
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,080
Why the heck you don’t pick up?

233
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,440
Huh? After 15 year with you,

234
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,320
"besides you like a fucking fool.

235
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,000
And not to get closer to you,
no, because of friendship."

236
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,920
Because of love, do you hear me?

237
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,720
"Because of love.

238
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,640
I’d been very close
to breaking up with everything,"

239
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,320
To ditching Mari Carmen for a bitch
that not even Prieto would fuck.

240
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,760
"Do you hear me? Yes, you’re a bitch."

241
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,720
A selfish and obsessive bitch.
You’re a fucking bitch, a fucking bitch.

242
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,160
A cunt licker.

243
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,400
"A frigid, for fuck’s sake, a...."

244
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,240
"How many punches can you take
before falling on the canvass?

245
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,360
If you are Raquel Murillo, many.

246
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,520
But there’s something wrong in being good
at rolling with the punches."

247
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,400
"Attention, inspector Murillo
is approaching the front wall."

248
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,360
"If the punches don’t cease,
you’ll end up falling down the same.

249
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,520
And when you fall down,

250
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,440
it’ll be as all the punches
were received at the same time."

251
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,520
Raquel!

252
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,720
-Raquel!
-Raquel!

253
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,440
Raquel!

254
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,080
"Murillo stopped hearing,

255
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,320
stopped thinking.

256
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,960
She just walked on.

257
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,760
It was an empty body

258
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,520
searching for all that to end."

259
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,840
Raquel!

260
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,360
Come!

261
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,960
Let’s go, let’s go!

262
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,200
Excuse me, I didn’t quite understand.

263
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,560
Freedom.

264
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
-I said I want...
-No, no.

265
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,440
Wait, before you give me
an answer seriously, I want...

266
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,240
I would like to you to take into account
a couple considerations.

267
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,480
The first one is...

268
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,360
You must consider

269
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,520
that you and I have a relationship.

270
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,600
And the second

271
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,120
is that freedom carries
a lot of un unexpected situations,

272
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,920
risks and terrible things, perhaps,
that for me, personally, are scary.

273
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,880
Do you know that eagle chicks

274
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
fall off before the right time

275
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,200
and crash on to the rocks?
That makes me scared.

276
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,880
Or baby rabbits, leverets,
that are in their dens.

277
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,720
They see the sunlight,

278
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,160
and come out,

279
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,360
and a wolf breaks their neck in one bite.

280
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,120
That makes me scared.

281
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,440
No, Ariadna? Because...

282
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,080
Perhaps now,
at this particular moment, leaving is

283
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,560
far more dangerous

284
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
than staying.

285
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,120
And I wouldn’t like that anything bad
happened to you, Ariadna.

286
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,840
I don’t want you
to become distressed, either.

287
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,120
I don’t want that. I’ll give you
two hours to think about it.

288
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,280
I must leave.

289
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,800
I’m pregnant,
I need to see a gynaecologist,

290
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,760
well, also the orthopaedic surgeon.

291
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,800
Or whatever doctor you see, I don’t know
which specialist I have to see

292
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,360
for a bullet wound in your leg.

293
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,000
It’ll be the internal medicine doctor,
won’t it? I don’t know.

294
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,880
Let’s see, what’s wrong?

295
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,080
The million euros is not appealing enough?

296
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,120
-With that money you can leave ever after.
-It depends.

297
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,560
If the wound becomes gangrenous
and I end up limping...

298
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,640
If that happens,
we’ll think of what to do.

299
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,800
You don’t need to expect for the worst.

300
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,760
I should think.

301
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,600
Besides, you’re very well here,
aren’t you?

302
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,440
You’ve got your own bedroom, Mónica
Gaztambide’s Presidential suite, or not?

303
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,720
You might even miss us...

304
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,240
if you go.

305
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,640
Why are you insisting on me staying?

306
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,440
You won’t have fallen in love,
haven’t you?

307
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,160
It’s not true.

308
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,360
Listen, look at me, are you serious?

309
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,280
-So what if I am serious?
-Let’s see.

310
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,920
-You can’t fall in love in 60 hours.
-Well, in 60 hours.

311
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,880
In 60 hours I shot you,
I extracted the bullet.

312
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,720
You found out you were pregnant,
now abortion yes, abortion no,

313
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,320
shall I break up with my boyfriend.

314
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,880
You have sex with me.

315
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,000
If you give 24 more hours,
I might ask you to marry me.

316
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,360
And then 24 hours later, we get a divorce.

317
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,760
What the fuck does time matter
inside here?

318
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,560
-In the end time is something that...
-All right.

319
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,400
All right, what?

320
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,160
I’ll stay.

321
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,000
But to get married and that
you’ll have to give a little more time.

322
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
I don’t know, 16 minutes or so.

323
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,400
RAQUEL’S UNKNOWN’S TELEPHONE

324
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,320
Hello?

325
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,000
Sorry to phone you again.
It’s Raquel’s mother.

326
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,400
As the other day you were
so close to my daughter,

327
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,160
you see, I have an urgent message
from detective Ángel.

328
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,080
"And I can’t get through to her.
Are you near her?"

329
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,320
Not now,
but I’ll be seeing her in a moment.

330
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,040
"If you tell me,
I may be able to talk to her."

331
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,880
Thank you ever so much,
because it seemed important.

332
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,040
What message?

333
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,520
I’ll read it for you.

334
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,560
Yes, "we have him, we have the fucking guy

335
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,320
"who is helping them from outside.
It’s the guy that makes cider,

336
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,680
the one who was in the wreck yard,
the one who threatened"

337
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,440
the Russian guy", one second.

338
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,920
"His fingerprints were in the patrol car.
We have him.

339
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,120
I’m on my way to the tent
and I’ll tell you everything."

340
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,640
Have you written all down?

341
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,560
Yes, don’t worry.

342
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,640
-"I’ll take care of it."
-Well, thank you very much again.

343
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,560
-"Thank you so much."
-You’re welcome.

344
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,120
"The Professor had built a plan down
to the last millimetre.

345
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,200
Each movement of the police,
any possible mistake from his gang,

346
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,400
the hostages’ behaviour,
each variable, everything,

347
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,880
And then, when he thought
everything was under his control,

348
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,480
he found out that it wasn’t so.

349
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,320
It would have never crossed his mind

350
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,880
that to avoid the whole plan
going down the toilet,

351
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,400
he would have to kill.

352
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,040
Kill the mother of the woman
he was falling in love with.

353
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,040
And, of course,

354
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,320
no one is prepared for that."

355
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,640
What did you give me?

356
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,000
An intravenous sedative.

357
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,280
Have you already spoken to the hostages?
What did they say?

358
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,840
So far they’ve confirmed
that they’re building a tunnel.

359
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,120
We’re going to locate the exact position.

360
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,320
And what we already know,
that they are armed up to the teeth.

361
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,200
Raquel.

362
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,480
You’re the most qualified person
to lead this operation,

363
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,880
but it’s high time you had a rest.

364
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,600
Don’t worry about anything.

365
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,280
The superintendent is on his way
to substitute you.

366
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,960
So you can go home for a few hours.

367
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,800
You have to sleep.

368
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,640
Can I make a phone call?

369
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,880
Sure.

370
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,840
Here.

371
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,320
"Salva, it’s Raquel."

372
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,360
Look, I need you to come over
to get me out of here.

373
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,240
This is the worst day of my life"

374
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,760
and I have to get away from this tent,
from this city.

375
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,600
Salva, are you there?

376
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,440
I can’t, there’s something I have to do.

377
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,800
Sure, sure, I understand.

378
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,400
"To phone like this

379
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,640
is a bit...."

380
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,320
-Good morning.
-Hello.

381
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,200
Can I help you?

382
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,000
I’m Salva, your daughter’s friend.

383
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,000
-We spoke on the phone.
-Yes, yes, of course.

384
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,080
Come in, come in.

385
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,240
Thank you.

386
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,560
Thank you.

387
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,560
Come in.

388
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,760
He’s not reacting.

389
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,320
I don’t want to be pessimistic,

390
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,920
but I’m afraid his brain injury
has caused irreversible damage.

391
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,600
What? Are you a neurosurgeon?

392
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,840
We don’t know.

393
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,040
We must take him to a hospital.

394
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,240
He might still have a chance to be cured.

395
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,840
No one leaves.

396
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
Do you hear me? With hole or not hole.

397
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,280
-You know what the Professor said.
-I couldn’t care less about the Professor.

398
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,400
Where was the Professor
when the 16 hostages were escaping?

399
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,120
Where was he
when they smashed Oslo’s head?

400
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,360
We open the doors, call the police and let
the paramedics come and take him out.

401
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,840
What the fuck are you talking about?
The rules were clear, no one goes out.

402
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,800
We all agreed, Oslo too.

403
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,920
16 hostages have escaped.

404
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,960
The rules have changed.

405
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,640
The hostages don’t know
what’s happening here, Oslo does.

406
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,160
And so, huh? If he can’t even speak.

407
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,280
Even if he could he wouldn’t betray us.
Damn, let’s vote.

408
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,080
This isn’t a nice democracy.

409
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,360
It isn’t, no.

410
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,920
We open the doors

411
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,880
and we let Oslo out.

412
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,160
No one is leaving.

413
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,720
Berlin.

414
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,120
Oslo isn’t leaving.

415
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,560
Me speak with Oslo before entering.

416
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,680
Wound doesn’t matter.

417
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,280
Death before prison.

418
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,440
You understand?

419
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,400
Yes.

420
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,040
Me take care of Oslo.

421
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,560
I must say, you have a beautiful house.

422
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,920
Thank you very much.

423
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,600
Raquel is not at home.
Poor her, she works so hard...

424
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,480
I was having a coffee.
Would you like to take one?

425
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,200
-I wouldn’t like to bother you.
-It’ll only take me a few minutes.

426
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,760
-Ah, then, thank you very much.
-Very well. Have a seat.

427
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,200
"There are 10,000 ways
to kill an elderly woman,

428
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,920
but the Professor was no hit man.

429
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,040
He was more of a chess player
for whom the world of crime was too big.

430
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,200
So he chose a cleaner
and more intelligent option.

431
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,000
Pour 2.5 milligrams of dioxin
into the old lady’s coffee,

432
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,600
wait until the cardiac arrest
occurred due to the drug

433
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,040
and vanish."

434
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,600
Any sugar?

435
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,720
Yes, please, three spoonful.

436
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,720
You have a sweet tooth, haven’t you?

437
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,720
So have I.

438
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,280
But I shouldn’t.

439
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,760
"Three sugar spoonful and one of dioxin.

440
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,600
In 15 minutes time
she would have a heart attack.

441
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,480
In 30 minutes Raquel
would find her mother’s body.

442
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,640
In an hour, a coroner

443
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,760
would authorize the removal of the body
as it was a cardiovascular heart attack.

444
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,640
No signs of violence,

445
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,600
the victim’s age, the door closed,
inside her home.

446
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,840
There would be no autopsy,
and the Professor knew it."

447
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,800
Thank you.

448
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,200
"Clean and simple."

449
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,080
My daughter didn’t come home last night.

450
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,920
Was she with you?

451
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,680
Well...

452
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,200
Well, actually, she was.

453
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,760
Yesterday we met.

454
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,960
Well.

455
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,960
Did you make love?

456
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,720
Well...

457
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,440
Actually we did.

458
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,160
I’m glad.

459
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,160
Sorry for prying into your life,
but I’m really glad.

460
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,480
My daughter desperately needs to be loved
and someone to make love to her.

461
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,600
And a man who is a good man.

462
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,120
And you seem a good man.

463
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,040
I can see it in your eyes.

464
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,200
Excuse me.

465
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,040
I’ve dropped it.

466
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,360
As we get older we become clumsy...

467
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,880
Excuse me.

468
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,120
Oslo won’t speak again.

469
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,760
I’m very sorry, it’s...

470
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,720
-It’s very tragic.
-You knew about escape?

471
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,560
No.

472
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,200
Denver tell me.

473
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,080
You knew about escape.

474
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,000
Know as such, I didn’t know.

475
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,600
I could hint something,
and I told Denver to help.

476
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,960
They hit him with this pipe

477
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,320
behind back.

478
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,040
Oslo friend.

479
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,160
Me and Oslo, together in war,

480
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,480
peace together,

481
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,280
robberies together,

482
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,800
prison together.

483
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,960
Oslo friend.

484
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,320
You understand, Arturo?

485
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,760
On your knees.

486
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,880
Did you really think
we wouldn’t try to escape,

487
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,240
that we wouldn’t defend ourselves,

488
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,280
that we would stand there
watching how you killed us,

489
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,400
how you tortured us, how you raped us?

490
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,720
One and a thousand times
I would do it again.

491
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,080
If you’re going to do it, hit me hard,
because if you don’t kill me,

492
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,400
I might kill you afterwards.

493
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,120
I came to work

494
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,960
as any other day

495
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,400
without harming anyone,

496
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,400
only to fulfil my duty.

497
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,160
Who do you think the good guys are,
Helsinki?

498
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,480
You?

499
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,320
Finish quickly, please.

500
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,680
Bring me over the dustpan and the mop,
they are there, in that corner, please.

501
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,640
Thank you.

502
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,600
I’ll do it.

503
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,240
"I don’t live in Almazán now,
I live in Madrid.

504
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,600
I have two daughters: Raquel y Laura.

505
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,840
I’ll never go to an old people home.

506
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,360
Raquel is a serious woman,
but she loves me very much."

507
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,040
Excuse me?

508
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,400
"We have him, it’s the cider guy.

509
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,080
His fingerprints were in the patrol car."

510
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,440
-Do you mind if I make a phone call?
-No, of course not.

511
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,840
"Raquel, it’s me again.
Phone me, your voice mailbox is full.

512
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,800
We have him, listen, we have him.

513
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,440
We have the guy
who is helping them from outside.

514
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,440
Yes, it’s Salva, Salva.
Salva, the guy who makes cider.

515
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,200
He was in the wreck yard,
he threatened the Russian guy.

516
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,120
For fuck’s sake, he’s using you, damn.
His fingerprints are in the patrol car.

517
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,880
He’s getting close to you
to know about the investigation.

518
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,880
If you wish to hear the message again,
press 1.

519
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,920
To delete it, press 2.

520
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,480
To save it, press...

521
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,040
Message deleted.
There are no more messages."

522
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,120
No one is answering.

523
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,080
Salva?

524
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,440
But what are you doing here?

525
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,200
This was the thing I had to do.

526
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,800
The only thing, I left your garden
in a really bad state.

527
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,120
Isn’t he adorable?

528
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,280
He’s already told me

529
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,560
you made love.

530
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,840
-Mum.
-What?

531
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,120
I didn’t say anything,
she must have suspected it.

532
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,880
Time to eat.

533
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,640
-Would like some pudding?
-Well, I’ll have to taste them.

534
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,720
If there as tasty as this soup.
It’s the best one I’ve ever tasted

535
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,000
-in a very long time.
-Thank you.

536
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,240
Darling, don’t play with your food.
You’re hardly eating anything.

537
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,000
It’s that job.

538
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,960
It makes her very stressed.

539
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,360
-The kidnapping, have you heard about it?
-Yes.

540
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,680
You’re telling me.

541
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,360
I follow it constantly,
I’m following it in the press.

542
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,560
It’s terrible what’s happening.

543
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,120
I’m all worried.

544
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,760
There was some shooting
inside yesterday, huh?

545
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,400
Wasn’t there, and some explosions.
No, I really...

546
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,120
those people armed to the teeth...

547
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,600
Who knows, any day,
some horrific thing will happen.

548
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,520
"There was shooting yesterday.
Armed to the teeth.

549
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,680
They have at least three M-16.

550
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,760
A Browning ground machine gun.

551
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,520
Retroxil, is a medicine.

552
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,520
In Toledo there has been
an unusual demand."

553
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,400
-Where was the last purchase?
-Here, in Palomeque.

554
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,760
18th of October.

555
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,280
Excuse me, I have to make a phone call.

556
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,080
But, darling...

557
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,240
Every day the same.

558
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,360
Suárez, put me on speakers.

559
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,600
Connect my mobile to the loud speakers.
We have communication with the Inspector.

560
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,560
-Turn it up.
-Well, listen up everyone.

561
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,960
I need you to look for

562
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,800
"all the rural estates
where hunting is allowed"

563
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,360
within 100 kilometres distance
from the pharmacy in Palomeque.

564
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,760
I want a map of Toledo now.
Look for a map,

565
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,280
-perimeter of Palomeque.
-"If they bought the medicines there,"

566
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,000
it means that they were close.

567
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,240
Fuck, how didn’t I realize sooner?
Because they need a place

568
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,880
where they could organize it, where they
could prepare their plan step by step.

569
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,160
They had to do target practice
before entering the Fábrica,

570
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,520
somewhere where the shots and detonations

571
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,680
wouldn’t raise any alarms.

572
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,080
I want some units canvassing
the perimeter of Palomeque

573
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,240
within 100 kilometres, I want them now.

574
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,400
Documentation.

575
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,400
It must be a 100 hectares rural estate.

576
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,200
Look it up in the land registry.

577
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,040
With a house in it.

578
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,160
-Suárez, call me when you find something.
-I will.

579
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,720
You heard her. We have no time to waste,
let’s get them, okay?

580
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,000
That estate, those units.
I want it all, I want it now.

581
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,240
Yes?

582
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,480
Are you all right?

583
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,440
Yes, a bit tired. Come in.

584
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,360
And dazed too.
They had to inject me a sedative

585
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,200
and, the truth, I’m not used to.

586
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,960
I see, I’m not very clearheaded today,
either.

587
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,640
You’ll excuse me, Salva, but I need
to lie down. I need to get some sleep.

588
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,840
Sure, sure.

589
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,640
It’s the time now to make a decision.

590
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,080
You have to choose between being
accomplices and getting a million euros

591
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,760
or being upright people and leaving.

592
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,280
Freedom

593
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,400
or one million euros.

594
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,720
If you stay with us
to see the end of this,

595
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,760
you’ll receive, at home,
20,000 banknotes of 50 euros,

596
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,560
in an air-tight bag

597
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,760
like good ham.

598
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,600
Those who want to leave,
please, cross the line.

599
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,520
What will we do
with those who choose their freedom?

600
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,120
You’ll take them downstairs

601
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,800
to the Fábrica basement

602
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,560
and lock them up there.

603
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,680
I know it’s terrible, but...

604
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,000
precisely those are the ones
that could actually try to rise up

605
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,360
another rebellion.

606
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,440
And I need to protect you.

607
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,360
Why can’t I choose to leave?

608
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,600
Because you’re our top hostage, darling.

609
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:13,960
Really?

610
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,360
Do we need to explain it to you?

611
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,520
Move aside, you’re in the way.

612
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,160
Okay, time is ticking. Now or never.

613
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,120
You can either cross the line

614
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,840
and leave

615
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,840
or stay with us

616
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,160
and your million euros.

617
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,280
Very good.

618
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,480
Those wanting to leave,
put your hands on your head.

619
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,040
Move forward, through the door
to the loading area.

620
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,640
"What the Professor had gained
was to divide the hostages

621
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,240
into those who would become our partners

622
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,880
and those who could still
complicate things.

623
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,400
At least that’s what we thought.

624
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,280
Yes, Suárez.

625
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,240
Inspector, we have a rural estate.
It matches perfectly the description.

626
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,520
-Where is it?
-"Near Palomeque",

627
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,800
the small town where the pharmacy is.
It’s 640 hectares

628
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,520
"and it’s a private hunting land.
There’s a house too"

629
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,560
big enough to plan a heist
of that magnitude.

630
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,760
-How did you find it?
-"A neighbour in the area

631
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,240
saw a group of youngsters
on the evening of San Juan.

632
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,080
"They didn’t look like hunters,
but all through the summer

633
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,240
-he heard explosions."
-Explosions.

634
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,440
Yes, explosions.
He doesn’t quite know what they were,

635
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,440
"but he’s sure they weren’t
hunting rifles, not with cartridge ."

636
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,320
I send units to the area
and arrange for an intervention team

637
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,760
-"for a possible armed intervention."
-Very good.

638
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,040
Send me the information to my mobile.
As soon as I can I’ll head there.

639
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,320
Lobo, we have the all clear,
we’re setting off.

640
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,400
Units 1, 2 and 3 ready, now!

641
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,880
Salva, look, I’m not feeling well.

642
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,400
Can you drive?

643
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,360
-Yes.
-I need you to drive me to a place.

644
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,920
Everything starts tomorrow.

645
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,880
Sergio.

646
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,520
I want you to promise me one thing.

647
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,720
If things go wrong,

648
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,200
you’ll run away.

649
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,240
You won’t be waiting at the hangar.

650
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,760
Nothing will go wrong.

651
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,120
You know, as I do,
that everything could go wrong.

652
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,000
I’ll only go there if you promise me
that, if things are shot to hell,

653
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,080
you won’t let them catch you.

654
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,200
I won’t promise you that.

655
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,960
Either you promise me now or you won’t
have a captain in charge from now on.

656
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,000
You already know me.

657
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,920
Nothing will go wrong, Andrés.

658
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,680
We’re the Resistance, aren’t we?

659
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,080
"The Professor’s whole life
revolved around just one idea:

660
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,160
Resistance.

661
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,240
His grandfather,

662
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,680
who had resisted next to the partisans
to defeat the fascists in Italia

663
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,280
had taught him that song.

664
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,760
And later on

665
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,160
he taught us."

666
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,520
Six kilometres straight on, and after
the first diversion on the right.

667
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,480
Salva, can you drive a little faster.

668
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,400
You won’t be fined being with me.
You’re driving at 40 km/h.

669
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,760
Yes, true, I’m sorry.
I’m a bit dense today.

670
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,280
Wait for me here.

671
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,480
On the left side
and on the right side too.

672
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,840
No one comes in without wearing a suit.
Whoever is not essential here

673
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,760
stay out of perimeter 1.

674
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,840
"Is it clear?

675
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,160
It’s clear."

676
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,120
We hit the jackpot.
There’s DNA of every type.

677
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,000
"I want the photographers
and the Scientific branch in.

678
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,080
Take photographs of everything."

679
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,640
The whole house has to be raided,
every single corner.

680
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,360
"We are on the first floor.

681
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,280
There’s an attic. It’s amazing.

682
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,560
You won’t believe what we’ve found."

683
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:22,760
Inspector.

684
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,760
You have to see this.

685
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,240
The whole thing is on the walls.

686
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,480
Timetables, photos, maps.

687
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,240
The whole fucking plan.

688
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,520
We have it, sirs.

689
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,400
"Their time is over."

690
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,960
TO BE CONTINUED
