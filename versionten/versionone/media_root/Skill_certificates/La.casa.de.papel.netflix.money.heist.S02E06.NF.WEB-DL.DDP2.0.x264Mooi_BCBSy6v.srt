2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,650
In concentration camps,

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,170
respect is a given.

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,770
Well, here's it's going to be the same.

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,010
You're going to dig the tunnel

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,890
until your hands bleed!

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,330
At night

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,370
you may cry in pain

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,210
in your cot,

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,570
but you will keep on digging!

11
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,730
You'll be on shifts without rest.

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,650
Otherwise, an epic
punishment awaits you.

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,530
Just like your leader.

14
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,850
A man who will kill
if he betrays us again.

15
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,650
Who will kill if he ever
yearns for freedom again.

16
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,730
Whose sweat,

17
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,450
kills.

18
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,010
A man of explosive nature.

19
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,410
Now they're going to be
scared of you, Arturo.

20
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,050
Although we've always
known you're "the bomb".

21
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,930
You're an outcast, so
you'll stay here, secluded.

22
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,490
Helsinki and everyone
else, to the tunnel!

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,410
Come on, let's go!

24
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,490
Let's go, quickly!

25
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,450
Seismographs detected unusual
activity underneath the factory.

26
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,490
The kidnappers have increased
the digging pace of the tunnel.

27
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,930
They'll finish it soon.

28
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,770
TUESDAY 05:41 PM

29
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,780
How much is left?

30
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,130
HOUR 103 OF THE HEIST

31
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,810
Two meters, according to the
GPR. Two and a half meters.

32
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,010
Where are they exiting?

33
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,130
We think right here.

34
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,410
In a drainpipe 15 meters
behind the building.

35
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,250
Attention, everyone. I want you
all ready. Warn underground units.

36
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,610
I want 20 men guarding
that drainpipe now.

37
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,410
You know what guilty people do when
they are taken to the crime scene?

38
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,490
They don't stop talking.

39
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,170
About weather, politics,

40
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,090
they make jokes.

41
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,730
Because they're nervous.

42
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,010
They can't stand the silence.

43
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,010
But you...

44
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,890
you don't say a thing.

45
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,850
What do you want me to talk about?

46
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,410
Who are you?

47
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,330
Sergio Marquina.

48
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,090
Sergio?

49
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,970
Salva,

50
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,050
the Professor?

51
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,170
The person who has kept

52
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,410
all the police, the CNI,

53
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,970
and the Special Forces in check?

54
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,450
The man I've been talking with
on the phone for five days,

55
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,410
who I told what

56
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,850
clothes I wear and even
what color my orgasms are?

57
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,090
And which one are you?

58
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,570
Why aren't your fingerprints
in the national ID database?

59
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,130
I stopped renewing my ID
before they went digital.

60
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,970
When?

61
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,450
More than

62
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,770
twenty years ago.

63
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,170
That opens up a world of
possibilities, doesn't it?

64
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,690
Because no one is going to report
the disappearance of a man who

65
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,290
doesn't exist.

66
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,570
It will make it easy for
me to burn your corpse.

67
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,930
Is that what you want?

68
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,250
To kill and burn me?

69
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,730
Yes.

70
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:03,890
I sure do.

71
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,570
Look...

72
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,810
perhaps as an inspector,

73
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,850
I shouldn't tell this to the
person who organized the heist

74
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,730
at the National Mint factory.

75
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,010
But as a woman...

76
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,370
as a woman

77
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,450
who has spent years being
afraid of everything,

78
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,130
everything,

79
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,690
who trusted someone,

80
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,290
someone who knew

81
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,850
how fragile and vulnerable she was,

82
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,810
who's been fooling her
from the fucking beginning!

83
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,490
Then it wouldn't be that
far-fetched, don't you think?

84
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,530
You could have...

85
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,690
you could have approached me,

86
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,290
coaxed me,

87
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,810
planted a bug on me. A
fucking bug, goddamn it!

88
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,010
But no. No, you couldn't.

89
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,330
Yesterday we were dreaming together.

90
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,410
Shit.

91
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,010
Talking about the future. The future!

92
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,650
Who the hell are you?

93
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,090
What are you, some disturbed fuck?

94
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,130
It was all planned, Raquel.

95
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,010
Everything. It was all...

96
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,050
I'm sorry. It was all planned out...

97
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,090
except what happened between us.

98
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,370
I don't know, I broke my own rules.

99
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,450
What?

100
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,450
I didn't consider that variable.

101
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,130
What the hell are you saying?

102
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,250
- What variable?
- Falling in love with you.

103
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,690
You really think I'll let
you go on with this crap?

104
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,450
Son of a bitch.

105
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,690
That I'll sit back while
you lie to my fucking face

106
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,650
as if I were a 15-year-old girl?

107
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,010
I'm not lying, Raquel.

108
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,250
I fell in love.

109
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,690
Say it again.

110
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,970
Say it again.

111
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,730
I dare you to say it again!

112
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,290
Raquel.

113
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,610
I fell in love with you.

114
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,010
I'm so sorry.

115
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,210
Fine.

116
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,650
Fine.

117
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,930
05:46 PM

118
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,930
Berlin, I need to talk to you.

119
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,290
Of course. I'm the boss again,

120
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,330
I need my pups to feed me.

121
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,330
What exactly did the Professor say?

122
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,770
about Tokyo?

123
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,290
He said he would try to free her.

124
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,610
And how the hell is he going to do that?

125
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,010
Rio, he's not doing it himself.

126
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,770
Who is?

127
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,570
The four Serbs who dug
the tunnel five years ago.

128
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,970
They're the wildcard
for extreme setbacks.

129
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,890
- When?
- I don't know.

130
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,290
You feel her absence, right?

131
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,970
Those who stay always have it worse.

132
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,130
Instead, she will be

133
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,490
broadening her experience,

134
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,810
enhancing her senses,

135
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,410
entertained.

136
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,730
Would you take the deal from the cops?

137
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,290
What does it matter?

138
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,130
What would happen if we got out of here?

139
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,330
Would we stay together?

140
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,290
Betraying your friends.

141
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,170
My friends with city names?

142
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,650
Tokyo, Berlin, Moscow, Denver.

143
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,330
I think my friends with
city names are really cool.

144
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,010
And I'll tell you something.

145
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,530
Try to hide if you accept the deal,

146
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,170
because if I see you, I'll
put a bullet in your head.

147
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,530
Women are quicker to move on.

148
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,570
You should know, just in case.

149
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,930
Tokyo is hot-headed,

150
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,290
but she'll be back

151
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,770
and we'll be together.

152
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,610
I know it.

153
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,450
Sure.

154
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,570
Of course you will.

155
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,970
I've always thought that.

156
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,530
If you betray us and leave,

157
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,610
and you need to call
me when you're sorry,

158
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,330
because believe me,

159
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,690
you will be,

160
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,770
you can call me at Alison's number.

161
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,450
I'll keep it on.

162
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,330
The cops will be
listening but who cares.

163
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,130
ACTIVE SIGNAL REPEATER

164
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,370
Suarez, Alison Parker's
phone has switched on.

165
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,610
Try hacking it.

166
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,650
Sealed camera, sir.

167
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,770
They're not calling or sending anything.

168
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,930
PAINTING AND RENOVATIONS

169
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,850
- What the fuck are you doing?
- God damn it!

170
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,490
This is convoy 727, we're getting hit!

171
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,610
<i>Base to convoy, we did not
copy that, please repeat.</i>

172
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,250
They've got jammers.

173
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,130
God fucking damn it!

174
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,610
<i>My guardian angel had not forsaken me.</i>

175
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,330
<i>And I felt like I was on
the haunted house ride.</i>

176
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,690
It's a bomb! What the hell
is going on over there!

177
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,770
They set an explosive!

178
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,970
<i>A dark tunnel where you don't
know when you'll be startled.</i>

179
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,610
- We're fucked!
- Shut tup!

180
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,170
<i>But how fun!</i>

181
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,570
What's going on?

182
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,290
What the hell is going on?

183
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,970
Let's go, they're shooting!

184
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,050
- Shut the hell up!
- We're fucked, Perez!

185
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,810
Shut up, goddamn it. Let me think!

186
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,970
Zero!

187
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,570
Stay alert.

188
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,610
Okay. No, stop.

189
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,890
Put the guns down or I'll shoot her.

190
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,330
Put the guns down or I'll shoot her.

191
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,410
If you shoot the girl, you die.

192
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,850
If you shoot me,

193
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,930
you die.

194
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,090
If you let go of the girl,

195
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,770
you live.

196
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,770
<i>If only every decision in this
world was that easy, right?</i>

197
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,050
Rio.

198
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,770
Rio!

199
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,610
I noticed you didn't agree
with what Helsinki was doing.

200
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,330
You're not like them.

201
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,450
You're a good boy.

202
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,530
I have a son your age, you know?

203
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,410
The eldest.

204
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,810
He's a good boy too.

205
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,570
Help me, please.

206
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,610
I want to see my son.

207
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,530
I found this machine to make passports.

208
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:18,130
- No...
- Monica, listen to me.

209
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,610
You can do whatever you want.

210
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,610
What if you change your mind?

211
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,690
It would be great for you
to have a new one. Besides...

212
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,490
this is real. Is good stuff.

213
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,930
I know. I work here.

214
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,290
- It's easy. We make it...
- No, really.

215
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,650
if you don't want it, toss
it, or keep it as a souvenir..

216
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,130
It's just two minutes.

217
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,570
- Let's do it?
- Okay, fine.

218
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,970
Is it plugged in?

219
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,250
- Yes.
- Okay.

220
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,570
What name do I use?

221
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,250
- Agata.
- Agata?

222
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,810
- What's the matter?
- It's a porn star's name.

223
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,610
Agata is a hot chick's name.

224
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,290
If you were ugly, I would say,

225
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,730
- Felisa or Maricruz...
- Maria!

226
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,850
- Maria Fernandez.
- Maria Fernandez?

227
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,570
That's not a name. Nobody's
believing that. Trust me,

228
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,130
- I know.
- It's discrete.

229
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,570
Agata sounds expensive.
It's classy. Use Agata.

230
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,050
Here you go.

231
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,570
Thanks.

232
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,450
Write "born in Madrid"

233
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,410
and whichever year you want.

234
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,930
- We're making a passport.
- I see.

235
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:33,930
In case in the end,

236
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,290
she runs or...

237
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,570
comes with us.

238
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,810
Who do you think stole your gun?

239
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,090
Let's go outside.

240
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,250
Suarez.

241
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,290
<i>I'm calling from the National Court.</i>

242
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,410
<i>The convoy with Silene Oliveira</i>

243
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,210
<i>was expected 15 minutes
ago and it's not here.</i>

244
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,570
<i>We haven't heard anything.</i>

245
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:10,970
Keep me informed.

246
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,850
Gomez, I need two units on
Oliveira's route to the courthouse.

247
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,370
She hasn't arrived. I need
to know what's going on.

248
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,450
Understood.

249
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,850
Put this on.

250
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,530
Only contact the Professor.

251
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,210
He'll say what to do.

252
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,410
<i>Never in my life had I felt so free.</i>

253
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,250
<i>But that time,</i>

254
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,690
<i>the Professor's plan wouldn't work.</i>

255
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,730
I know I let the pressure get to me,

256
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,530
I was wrong, but...

257
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,210
please,

258
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,290
I don't deserve this.

259
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,450
Please,

260
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:37,850
I'm asking you,

261
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,970
if there's any dignity
left in you, please.

262
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,410
I can't breathe.

263
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,970
I can't breathe. Help me.

264
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:46,970
Help me,

265
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,450
please.

266
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,570
We're coming in.

267
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,810
Take your food and sit down.

268
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,170
One meter between each one. Come on.

269
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,890
That's it, just like that,

270
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,250
joyfully.

271
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,770
Helsinki, say hello to little Arturo.

272
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,490
Something doesn't make sense.

273
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,450
They said that if I sweat too much

274
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,930
I would blow up, and
yet here they put me,

275
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,170
locked in this god-awful heat.

276
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:39,650
- In this dreadful heat...
- It's best if you stay calm and quiet.

277
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,770
It doesn't make sense.

278
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,250
- What?
- The bomb, that's what doesn't make sense!

279
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,250
You think they are going to
risk me tripping or sweating,

280
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,170
blowing up the whole plan? No...

281
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,730
No, that would be insane.

282
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,930
- They don't work like that.
- Shut up.

283
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,370
They're trying to
psychologically terrorize us.

284
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,810
They're trying to scare
us. This isn't real.

285
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,900
- It's a bluff.
- I don't want to know, so shut up.

286
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:09,290
I'm taking it off. I'm going
to take it off, I can't take it.

287
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,930
It's okay.

288
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,850
- If it was real we wouldn't be so close.
- Stop and sit down!

289
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,090
Who are you to tell us what to do, brat?

290
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,730
It's your fault that
we're all locked in here!

291
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,730
- My fault?
- Yes, your fault.

292
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:34,210
You are the director and
eight morons managed to slip in

293
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,130
like they owned the place.

294
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,570
Is there any mint in the
world that has been robbed?

295
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,130
Just this one, right?

296
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,610
Congratulations,

297
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,890
you've made history.

298
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,250
Now, please, don't blow us up,

299
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,570
and sit down.

300
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,690
Sit down.

301
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,730
<i>Headquarters, do you copy?
The van was hijacked.</i>

302
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,450
<i>- There's no trace of Silene Oliveira.</i>
- Copy that. Wait for instructions.

303
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,890
Attention, we have a fugitive!

304
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,530
Initiate Operation Cage!

305
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,450
<i>He wasn't there.</i>

306
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:51,970
<i>He wasn't there.</i>

307
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,770
<i>He had arranged it all.</i>

308
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,090
<i>He had saved me.</i>

309
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,170
<i>How could he not be there?</i>

310
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:03,370
<i>On that October afternoon after I
escaped they deployed Operation Cage.</i>

311
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,170
<i>It might ring a bell
from terrorist threats.</i>

312
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,650
<i>They cut off all the
exits to the city at once.</i>

313
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,010
<i>Everything collapses</i>

314
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,650
<i>and you're trapped. You can only hide.</i>

315
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,650
<i>My problem was that my
hideout was the hangar.</i>

316
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:20,090
<i>And the person who had to
let me in was the Professor.</i>

317
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,210
<i>But I was never too good at waiting.</i>

318
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,810
What's that?

319
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,650
The only truth I know about you
is that you're a professional liar.

320
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,530
And call me paranoid, but
you won't lie to me again.

321
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,610
I can guarantee it.

322
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,930
Do you think I don't know that?

323
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,530
That I'm an idiot?

324
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,010
Of course she stole the gun from me.

325
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,250
But changed her mind,

326
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,250
otherwise I would be in
a fucking box with Oslo.

327
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,010
She helped you. That's great.

328
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,010
But you don't have to make her
a passport or take her with you.

329
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,290
What if I want to?

330
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,850
What if I want to live
with her and raise her son?

331
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,530
You're going to be fucked enough
to be carrying more burdens.

332
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,970
Not a burden. It's a girl
who loves me and a child,

333
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,610
who is innocent.

334
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:56,850
- It's a mess you shouldn't get into.
- If I do, it's my choice.

335
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,770
Sometimes we try to help others and
end up sinking ourselves, damn it.

336
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,090
If I sink, I'll swim, like always, Dad.

337
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,410
It's not like that, dammit!

338
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,490
I know,

339
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,530
I tried to help your mother
every damn day of my life.

340
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,530
Where's this shit coming from now?

341
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,490
Mama abandoned us.

342
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,450
Where's this shit coming from now?

343
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,730
We abandoned her.

344
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,850
She was going to be the end of us.

345
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,090
I put her in a clinic in Barcelona.

346
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,010
It cost 200,000 pesetas.

347
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,770
And in less than 24 hours
she showed up at my hostel

348
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,690
- high as a kite on smack.
- What did you do?

349
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,210
It was the fourth time.

350
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,410
I'd lost my savings.

351
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,490
What the fuck did you do?

352
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,970
She wanted to buy more.

353
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,890
I put her in the car...

354
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,370
and dropped her off at a
roundabout in Martorell,

355
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,570
next to a place where they sold smack.

356
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,770
I didn't wait for her.

357
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,410
I went to pick you up to move out.

358
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,490
You left my mother at a roundabout?

359
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,450
That's why I got you into all this mess.

360
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,890
Because I don't want you
to live the life I lived.

361
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,290
I want you to be free.

362
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,370
- I want you to start from scratch.
- You don't abandon a mother.

363
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,450
You get her clean.

364
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,170
You had me believe she was a bitch.

365
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,850
I thought maybe I was
to blame for her leaving.

366
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,890
It was her or us.

367
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,210
I won't break your skull because
we need you to get out of here.

368
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:11,850
When we get out,

369
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,050
you and I are nothing.

370
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,090
Two strangers.

371
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,970
Denver and Moscow.

372
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,210
Did you finish the passport?

373
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,530
Yes.

374
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,250
Denver, are you okay?

375
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,890
It's fine.

376
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,490
I used Agata in the end.

377
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,290
<i>I drove nowhere, frantically.</i>

378
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,730
<i>In a fraction of a second
I knew where to go.</i>

379
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:06,850
<i>The problem</i>

380
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,530
<i>was that it was the most
guarded place in Spain.</i>

381
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:47,930
Take a deep breath.

382
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,130
Are you nervous?

383
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,370
No, I'm fine.

384
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,770
You see those lines?

385
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,330
Every one of your lies will draw

386
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:11,890
some ugly curves due to
alteration in blood pressure,

387
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,130
heart rate, breathing.

388
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,610
So don't lie to me or I'll know.

389
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,050
Name.

390
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:27,970
Sergio Marquina.

391
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,370
Place of birth.

392
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:36,930
San Sebastian.

393
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,650
Did you know you would destroy Angel?

394
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,570
Yes.

395
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:58,290
Was it you who caused his accident?

396
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,090
No.

397
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,490
Was it your idea to rob the Royal Mint?

398
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,530
No.

399
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,210
Whose was it?

400
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,570
My father's.

401
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:23,850
He died before carrying it
out, so it's kind of a homage.

402
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,170
The fucking apple story.

403
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,010
The fucking organic cider story

404
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,610
you told me in bed yesterday

405
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,690
was the story of the heist?

406
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,330
And I listened to you like an idiot.

407
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:48,050
You've been mocking
me since the beginning.

408
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,330
I was not mocking you. Look
at the polygraph, please.

409
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,530
Look at it.

410
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,210
My father had a sick child,

411
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,050
not a goddamn penny.

412
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,530
What would you have done?

413
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,250
He spent his time
thinking about robberies

414
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,930
to pay for a hospital
in the United States.

415
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,410
Out of despair.

416
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:20,490
To save my life.

417
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,410
My life.

418
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:32,010
Because nobody, nobody...

419
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:33,490
helped him.

420
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,210
And when he tried, he was shot to death

421
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,090
at the doors of a...

422
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,810
of a bank.

423
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,730
That's the truth.

424
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,930
I guess there are many ways
of understanding what is fair.

425
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,690
Did you think I was an easy target
because I was an abused woman?

426
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,490
Yes, I did.

427
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,930
When you leaked to the press

428
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:22,290
my refusal to release eight
hostages in favor of Alison Parker,

429
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:25,450
did you know I was going
to be publicly lynched?

430
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,310
That you were going to destroy my career

431
00:35:27,311 --> 00:35:29,210
in front of my mother and daughter?

432
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,530
Yes.

433
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,210
Okay.

434
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,530
You slept with me just because

435
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,190
- I'm the inspector in charge, right?
- No.

436
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,130
You slept with me because
I'm the inspector...

437
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,450
- No, no.
- Stop lying to me, dammit!

438
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,530
I'm not lying.

439
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,810
I have to believe you
have feelings for me?

440
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,050
You don't have to
believe anything. Raquel,

441
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,130
it's what I feel.

442
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,210
I didn't expect it.

443
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,050
It happened. And it happened to you too.

444
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,250
It happened to you too.
Why are we here if not?

445
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,330
Huh?

446
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,610
Why am I not in prison?

447
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,130
What the fuck is this?

448
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,890
Are you the crazy woman
from<i> Misery</i> or what?

449
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,770
It's something that we're both feeling.

450
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,290
Both, do you understand?
It happened to both.

451
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:27,850
Yes, Suarez.

452
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:32,210
<i>Inspector, Silene Oliveira has escaped.</i>

453
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,290
<i>- What?
- Going to the courthouse.</i>

454
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,170
<i>She asked to testify before a judge.</i>

455
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,730
The convoy was hijacked by people,
apparently eastern European.

456
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,770
I've initiated Operation Cage.
I hope they haven't left Madrid.

457
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,850
<i>Ask the judge immediately</i>

458
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,090
to issue an international
arrest warrant.

459
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,690
Cut off roads, ports and airports.

460
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,650
I want patrols on every border.

461
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,410
Tokyo escaped.

462
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:07,770
Was it you

463
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,850
who freed a murderer from
a maximum security prison

464
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:11,970
while held here?

465
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:23,250
Actually, I left everything ready
before meeting you at the cafe.

466
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:35,690
I apologize for receiving you
like this, but I just got here.

467
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,930
Radko, I'm so sorry about your brother.

468
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,410
You got it all planned in detail, right?

469
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,450
Raquel, I've told you everything.

470
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,730
I've come here without
resisting whatsoever.

471
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:09,690
And if I let you interrogate me it's...

472
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,450
because...

473
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:15,530
I wanted to be honest with
you. I can't take it anymore.

474
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,690
- The lying.
- Shut up.

475
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,890
- I didn't want to hurt you anymore.
- Shut up!

476
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,690
- This is a relief.
- Shut the fuck up, dammit!

477
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,290
I won't listen to you anymore. Look.

478
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,560
From now on, anything you have to say,

479
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:32,650
you say it directly to the judge.

480
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,370
Get up.

481
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,330
Get up, dammit!

482
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,130
Move, move.

483
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,490
Move!

484
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:51,970
Keep walking.

485
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,810
- I'm very sorry, Raquel.
- Keep walking!

486
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:02,930
I'm going to shoot you.

487
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,290
I'm going to...

488
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:30,210
<i>Have you heard the expression
"to enter the lion's den"?</i>

489
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,490
It's a call to Alison Parker's phone

490
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,530
- from an unknown number.
- Trace it.

491
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:56,930
- Yes?
- Rio?

492
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,530
It's Tokyo.

493
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,450
It's Silene Oliveira.

494
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,610
Record! Locate the call!

495
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,490
Where are you? Wait!

496
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:07,970
<i>They can hear us.</i>

497
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:09,850
It doesn't matter.

498
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,970
This is a love call.

499
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,570
<i>And the police enjoy love.</i>

500
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,210
<i>Listen to me.</i>

501
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,610
Remember the door my mother
used to draw when I was afraid?

502
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,010
What door is she talking about?

503
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,090
Yes, love. Of course I remember.

504
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,370
- What about it?
- I'll cross it.

505
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,050
<i>I'll cross the door to heaven,</i>

506
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,850
because my guardian angel isn't around.

507
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,370
In one minute.

508
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,090
I love you.

509
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:45,770
I love you too.

510
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,690
What the hell was that about?

511
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,730
It sounded like a goodbye.

512
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,810
<i>Attention. Unauthorized
vehicle entering the perimeter.</i>

513
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,570
Come on, everybody to your stations!

514
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:35,850
Hey, you!

515
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,290
It's her.

516
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,730
The door...

517
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:40,690
The door...

518
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,530
Shit, the door!

519
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,770
Hey, hey!

520
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,570
Attention!

521
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,290
<i>It's Silene Oliveira!</i>

522
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,610
Tokyo is back!

523
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,810
Tokyo is back!

524
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,010
On the ground!

525
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,050
We have to open the door, dammit!

526
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,890
Shoot the target, shoot the biker!

527
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:08,530
<i>Attention, fire.</i>

528
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:13,970
Let's go!

529
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,170
No! We have to cover her!

530
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,090
<i>Kidnapper in range, fire.</i>

531
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:29,970
Dad, look out!

532
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,370
<i>Take cover, behind you!</i>

533
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:25,050
Fuck!

534
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,570
Fuck!

535
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:00,330
Moscow!

536
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:01,930
Moscow!
