A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:22,875
MADRID
D-DAY

3
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,958
<i>Remember the Chernobyl Plan?</i>

4
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,500
<i>It was a desperate plan
from the previous job.</i>

5
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,666
<i>It involved collapsing Madrid
with a shower of bank notes</i>

6
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,125
<i>to escape among the turmoil
in case everything went wrong.</i>

7
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,166
<i>The plan was intended to create chaos.</i>

8
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,125
<i>And that was exactly
what we needed now.</i>

9
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:16,916
<i>Chaos.</i>

10
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,416
Do you want to answer it?

11
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Hello?

12
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,166
Wait, zeppelins?

13
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,166
I'll be there in eight minutes.

14
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:03,291
The zeppelins are programmed to fly
to certain GPS coordinates,

15
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:07,250
and only then
will they open their hatches.

16
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:11,250
<i>Afterwards, they will fly in circles
within a radius of 250 meters</i>

17
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,250
<i>and they will release wads of money
every 40 seconds</i>

18
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,333
for 50 minutes.

19
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:17,708
This...

20
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,541
at a height of 300 meters,
like manna falling from the sky.

21
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,250
<i>In total, we'll release 140 million euros.</i>

22
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,958
It's going to be expensive
to venture into the lion's den, huh?

23
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,125
You...

24
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,958
We have all been called Robin Hoods.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,625
It makes sense that part of the loot
ends with the people.

26
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,458
This message...

27
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,000
<i>goes to all of you who believe that
this mask is a symbol of the resistance.</i>

28
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,916
<i>We need you.</i>

29
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,875
<i>The State has declared war against us.</i>

30
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,375
<i>A dirty war.</i>

31
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,958
We have decided to stand up to them.

32
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,416
<i>The police have arrested one of us
in a foreign country.</i>

33
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,125
<i>Aníbal.</i>

34
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,458
<i>You can't sleep?</i>

35
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,041
Aníbal Cortés.

36
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:08,833
Come with me.

37
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,500
Let's go get some more coffee.

38
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,708
<i>It's been almost two months
since that happened.</i>

39
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,416
<i>No legal proceedings have been initiated.</i>

40
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,041
<i>No extradition has been requested.</i>

41
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,750
<i>No defense lawyer has been provided.</i>

42
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,166
<i>He's kept in captivity...</i>

43
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,916
<i>somewhere unknown.
And most likely...</i>

44
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,916
he's being tortured.

45
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,000
We demand...

46
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:42,000
the immediate end
to this illegal detention

47
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,500
<i>and that he be brought to justice in a way
that respects all legal safeguards.</i>

48
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,791
<i>The State has begun this war.</i>

49
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,916
And we shall not hide.

50
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,541
We shall fight,

51
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,583
<i>blow...</i>

52
00:04:58,916 --> 00:04:59,916
for blow.

53
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,333
<i>And this time...</i>

54
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,375
CALLAO THEATER

55
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,958
<i>...we're going big.</i>

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Furthermore,

57
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,833
this is a game of chess.

58
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:35,250
We're moving pieces
that will force the intelligence agency

59
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,500
to move theirs.

60
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,000
And Prieto will only be able
to do one thing...

61
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,666
I want the army in the streets!

62
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,625
They expect us to run
after those balloons,

63
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,583
but it's the biggest distraction tactic
we've ever seen.

64
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,125
Raise alert to Level 5.

65
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,083
If they have the fucking nerve
to announce they're stealing again,

66
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,000
they'll find everything
under protection. Shit!

67
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,416
Whoever strikes first...

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,684
has time on their side, but whoever
has to defend against that attack

69
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,541
won't have that much time
to think about it,

70
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,958
so Prieto will have to improvise
his strongest defense on the fly.

71
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,666
The PM just gave us the green light.

72
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,666
I want Madrid full of soldiers.

73
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,625
I also want LMVs, armored cars...

74
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:21,125
Armored cars, fuck! Armored cars!
There's nothing wrong with my mouth.

75
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,750
There lies our ruse.

76
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,333
Coming!

77
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:40,958
Martín.

78
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:47,708
May I?

79
00:07:55,208 --> 00:08:00,041
PALERMO, ITALY
2 MONTHS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

80
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,250
Want a drink?

81
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,166
The job was amazing.

82
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,458
I'm glad you're alive.

83
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,375
Thanks.

84
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,458
However, if you stay outside,
hidden like a rat,

85
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,958
your chances of survival increase.

86
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:53,750
- I was the most exposed during the job.
- No. Don't bullshit me.

87
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,333
Whoever faces the bullets
is the most exposed.

88
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,791
- How many times were you shot at?
- I'm not here to argue.

89
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:06,166
Quite frankly,
I couldn't care less why you're here.

90
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,458
Three years later...

91
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,041
and here you are.

92
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,916
So, I'll tell you
why you didn't go into the Mint.

93
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,125
Because you're a coward.

94
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:26,916
And because...

95
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,500
you had him do the dirty work.

96
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,583
Your brother.

97
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,541
A job always involves unknowns.
You know that.

98
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,833
Unknowns?

99
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,916
Let me be really clear.

100
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,083
You didn't go in...

101
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,125
and a third of your group died,
you son of a bitch.

102
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:58,250
A third of your group died
and you did nothing, for fuck's sake.

103
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,375
I'm as sorry as you are...

104
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:06,458
What the fuck are you sorry for?
You son of a bitch!

105
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,333
Andrés wouldn't have died
if I had been there.

106
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,750
I'd have gone in and gotten him out!

107
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,416
No matter the fucking cost!

108
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,250
Even if I had to blow up
the whole building!

109
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,708
I wouldn't have let him die! But you did!

110
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,708
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to,

111
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,541
one of those idiots from your group?

112
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,958
I know you well, Sergio.

113
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,500
I know what you're like.

114
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,541
He was my friend.

115
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,125
Someone indispensable to me.

116
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,125
He was my other half.

117
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,625
Look into my eyes...

118
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,958
and tell me you never considered that.

119
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,125
That, if need be,
he would let himself be killed.

120
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,708
Tell me that when you thought
the plan out, you son of a bitch,

121
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,791
you never considered your brother's death.

122
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,875
I didn't consider my brother's death.

123
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,291
Not once.

124
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,000
He was my life.

125
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,291
I'm sorry. It's not really your fault.

126
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,583
It wasn't your fault.

127
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,125
It wasn't.

128
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,208
How are you?

129
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,166
All right.

130
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,625
Hanging around with Johnnie Walker...

131
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,958
sucking down pills, eating canned food.

132
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,041
But I'm all right.

133
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,541
I found the formula.

134
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:10,708
Music.

135
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:18,083
Have you locked yourself up
and been listening to music all this time?

136
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,291
I can listen to music from my youth
and travel there.

137
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,916
To the shabbiest music bars
of Buenos Aires.

138
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,166
I dance and swing like before...

139
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,208
when pain didn't exist.

140
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,083
Dance with me.

141
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,750
Come on, don't be an ass.

142
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,125
Dance!

143
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,625
There you go.

144
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,541
Try this.

145
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,916
Why are you here?

146
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,083
To ask your permission.

147
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,208
I'm going to steal the gold.

148
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,958
I'd tell you
it's in my brother's memory, but...

149
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,875
the truth is...

150
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,916
I need to do it.

151
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,375
And I won't do it without you.

152
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,333
Mónica.

153
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,166
- Denver, not now.
- No, it's got to be now.

154
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,083
Because I'm not going in
if we don't fix it.

155
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,833
Grab your M16 and do what you have to.

156
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,333
I didn't mean what I said.

157
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,583
It was 3:00 in the morning.
I'm a loudmouth, forgive me.

158
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,666
But to stop talking to me
for three days...

159
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,833
Things are starting to move.

160
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,666
Can you hear me?

161
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:03,708
Copy.

162
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,416
- Can you?
- Hold on.

163
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,333
Now. Try again.

164
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,416
What are you wearing, Inspector?

165
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,250
Let's do it.

166
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,916
<i>With money to invest in R&D,
you can achieve wonderful things.</i>

167
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,291
<i>Three weeks prior to the job,</i>

168
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,735
<i>we were inside both the CNI's
and the police's mobile phones</i>

169
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,958
<i>apps like WhatsApp.</i>

170
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,458
<i>We could activate their mics,</i>

171
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,541
<i>cameras and GPS.</i>

172
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,416
ISLAMABAD
PAKISTAN

173
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:55,000
<i>It took less than an hour to take over
the defense staff's telecommunications.</i>

174
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,583
<i>Rio's job...</i>

175
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,625
<i>was now done by 65 Pakistanis.</i>

176
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,500
<i>They didn't look like they went to
parties in Silicon Valley,</i>

177
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,833
<i>but they were geniuses.</i>

178
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,708
<i>Thanks to them,
we had access to everything.</i>

179
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,458
Seventy-six.

180
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,000
Three.

181
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,583
Three hundred twelve.

182
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,750
<i>Top priority
for the following forward lines.</i>

183
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:37,333
<i>Second Squad, First Company of Brunete:
the Congress of Deputies.</i>

184
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,916
<i>First Squad, Second Company
of Cuatro Vientos: the Royal Palace.</i>

185
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,708
<i>Third Squad, First Company of Paracuellos:
the Senate.</i>

186
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,250
<i>First Squad, Seventh Company of El Goloso:
Moncloa Palace.</i>

187
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,708
<i>First Squad, Sixth Company of BRIPAC:</i>

188
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,708
<i>Bank of Spain.</i>

189
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:51,833
BANK OF SPAIN
BRIPAC

190
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,375
Attention.

191
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,458
<i>Yours is the First Squad, Sixth Company
of BRIPAC.</i>

192
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,875
Ladies and gentlemen,

193
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,250
ours is the First Squad, Sixth Company
of BRIPAC.

194
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,541
One-six, BRIPAC.

195
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,083
You have 17 minutes.

196
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:13,000
We have 16 minutes and 45 seconds!

197
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,916
Warm heart, cool head. Come on!

198
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,166
BRIPAC!

199
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,958
Sixth company!

200
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,625
V-I?

201
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,208
BPAC VI

202
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,291
Do I need to say again
that there's no time left? Move!

203
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,833
All ready in 7 minutes!

204
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,416
Hurry the fuck up!

205
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,333
3 DAYS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

206
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,291
Stop shaking your leg,
you're going to wake Cincinnati.

207
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,166
Cincinnati is very quiet.

208
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,458
But I'm not.

209
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:06,375
So, I'll tell you straight out:
I don't want you to go into the bank.

210
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,333
We have a fucking baby.

211
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,375
- Calm down before...
- I'm not calming down.

212
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,458
I'm not calming down
because I haven't slept for three weeks.

213
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,416
We are no Bonnie and Clyde, Mónica.

214
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,250
You're a management secretary, not Rambo.

215
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,625
Shit!

216
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,208
- Denver...
- What?

217
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,666
I'm ready to go in and I will.

218
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,583
Ready to do what?

219
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,625
To be here, camping with the Professor?

220
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,208
At the summer camp of crime!

221
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,833
- Listen to me!
- No, you listen to me, Mónica!

222
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,041
I've been preparing since I was a child.

223
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,291
I'd go into the street with a ball
and they'd just take it from me.

224
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,541
And what did I do? Fight.
And the next day, it would happen again.

225
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,541
And the next, and the next...

226
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,708
By the time I was 9,
no one dared to step up to me.

227
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,541
You can't learn that in a day.
And you can't leave a kid...

228
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,208
here with some monks.

229
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,875
I'm not leaving my kid.

230
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,541
It's only going to be for three days,
not forever.

231
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,916
What about breastfeeding him?

232
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,800
<i>Breastfeeding him?
The kid already eats steak!</i>

233
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,958
<i>- You're taking away his breast milk.
- No!</i>

234
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,458
Helsi, are you awake?

235
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,291
Yes, awake.

236
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,333
<i>You're his mother, for fuck's sake!</i>

237
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,250
I can't sleep
with Jesus Christ watching...

238
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,493
Christ is watching those two.

239
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,166
Listen to Denver... I'm done with him.

240
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,250
Shut up!

241
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,166
And listen to me.

242
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,000
I am a mother. But I'm also your wife.

243
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,666
- And I'm a robber, too.
- No, you're not.

244
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,791
Having a kid doesn't mean
I have to renounce the other two.

245
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,636
Same as you. You're a dad, but
you don't even consider sitting it out.

246
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,458
We may not be Bonnie and Clyde,
but I learn fast

247
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,333
and I don't flinch.

248
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,000
I prepared and passed
my exam for the Royal Mint in six weeks.

249
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,708
What's that got to do with it?
There are no exams for robbery!

250
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,583
The office girl is gone.

251
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,458
Mónica Gaztambide is gone, Denver.

252
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,333
She stayed back at the Royal Mint

253
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,916
shooting at the police
to save you, Tokyo and Rio.

254
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,750
So, don't tell me I'm sitting it out
to warm up baby bottles,

255
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,416
because I am more of a robber than any
other motherfucker.

256
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,500
Fucking sexist.

257
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,041
Nairobi.

258
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,125
- Don't leave me alone.
- Hey!

259
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,708
Are you all right?

260
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,041
No, I'm not all right.

261
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,375
Can't blame you. I heard it all.

262
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,666
That ass talking
about breastfeeding and all.

263
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:22,000
- You're part of this gang.
- Mónica, you didn't get what I meant.

264
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,916
She got every single thing you said.
You are a real caveman!

265
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,480
- Go to bed!
- I'm not talking to you!

266
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,851
- Go to your cave!
- Are you all right, girls? What happened?

267
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,833
The patriarchy is fucking unbearable.

268
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,416
The patriarchy?

269
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,375
Patriarchy, that old model
with its macho chauvinism...

270
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,583
Speaking of that.

271
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,791
Do you know what the real patriarchy is?

272
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:39,708
What?

273
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:40,791
It's hanging here!

274
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,750
What the fuck is wrong with you!
It's 3 a.m.

275
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,083
Relax!

276
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,000
Go and do the dishes!

277
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,458
You're not sexist, you're just an asshole!

278
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,375
Go to your room!
Go count your pubic hairs!

279
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,833
Me and my dick and my dick...

280
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,250
Do you know what time it is?

281
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:00,833
It's 3 a.m.

282
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,750
Tomorrow morning we need
to practice with the thermic lances,

283
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:07,541
at 3580 degrees Celsius. I think...

284
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,500
you should rest.

285
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,708
Go to bed.

286
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,375
Mónica, please, come with me.

287
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,416
Sorry, Professor. We had a fight...

288
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,708
I was going to sleep with Tokyo.

289
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:52,083
42 MINUTES PAST H-HOUR

290
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,250
Are you all right?

291
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:04,875
Nervous.

292
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,333
Well, calm down because this is like...

293
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,791
playing chess.

294
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,875
More like
the World Chess Championship, so...

295
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,416
It's going to be a long match.

296
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,125
The opening...

297
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,750
One battle and...

298
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,083
two opposing strategies.

299
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,583
And then checkmate.

300
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Look.

301
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,041
Here, on this side.

302
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,666
See if you can feel it.

303
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:47,958
Another one.

304
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:49,750
Yeah.

305
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,125
Like a tiny kick.

306
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:58,708
Every time I have some coffee,
it goes crazy in there.

307
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,250
Now, tell me about the carrier.

308
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,541
I don't know anything about any handler.

309
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,625
You don't?

310
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,125
Yes, you do.

311
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:21,833
Put the mask on.

312
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:28,833
I don't want to.

313
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:33,125
Either you do it or I get Osman to do it.

314
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:42,791
Come on...

315
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,958
Another little horsey ride.

316
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,041
Let's see if we start remembering.

317
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:55,208
My ankles are so swollen.

318
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
There they are.

319
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,416
Motherfuckers!

320
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:20,166
<i>I was overwhelmed
by all those people insulting us.</i>

321
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:29,958
<i>I'd have liked to lean
out the window and shout:</i>

322
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:33,541
<i>"I'm Tokyo, one of you.</i>

323
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,041
<i>We are Dalí..."</i>

324
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,708
This mask has become a symbol.

325
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,208
Across the whole world.

326
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,000
Whether for those resisting,

327
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
indignant or skeptical...
it doesn't matter.

328
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,200
What really matters is
that it has inspired many people.

329
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,375
Look at that.

330
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:58,208
This is a demonstration against
corruption in Rio de Janeiro.

331
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,416
Buenos Aires, Argentina,

332
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,000
several women's rights marches.

333
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:10,708
Colombia.

334
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:14,666
Rome.

335
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:16,875
Paris.

336
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:22,166
The G20 Summit in Hamburg.

337
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,750
LIBERTY, EQUALITY,
RESISTANCE

338
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,583
They have filled entire stadiums.

339
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:28,875
This is France.

340
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,208
Saudi Arabia.

341
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,750
What I'm trying to explain to you is that

342
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:38,291
we have inspired many people
to fight with us.

343
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,666
All those people are now one of us.

344
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,416
Don't you ever forget that.

345
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:55,333
<i>And there they were.</i>

346
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:58,083
<i>The Professor had put on the mask,</i>

347
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,416
<i>called all the Dalís out</i>

348
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,916
<i>and the Dalís had responded.</i>

349
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,208
<i>They planned it all out
on social media and WhatsApp groups.</i>

350
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:08,541
<i>And they shouted</i>

351
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:11,541
<i>what we needed to hear the most.</i>

352
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,250
<i>"You will never walk alone."</i>

353
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,291
ENOUGH

354
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,791
<i>But that was mere poetry.</i>

355
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,875
<i>The real action
was about to begin then and there.</i>

356
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:28,333
TRAITORS

357
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:33,166
BANK OF SPAIN
47 MINUTES PAST H-HOUR

358
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,500
Come on! Move, move!

359
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:48,500
- Step back! Everyone!
- Let's all stay calm.

360
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,958
Come on, come on!

361
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,166
Don't move! Nobody moves!

362
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:01,458
The real convoy is on its way.

363
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,583
It's five miles away.

364
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,583
Five miles only takes six minutes.

365
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,750
They only have six minutes to make it.

366
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,458
Hail Mary.

367
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,208
Fuck off.

368
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:39,375
You must answer, "Full of grace."
We're in a holy place.

369
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:41,083
You can be such an ass...

370
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,083
Good afternoon. May I?

371
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:46,833
Of course, Sergio, of course.

372
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,250
Thank you.

373
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,625
I've been studying the two plans,
in depth.

374
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:56,083
I compared both. And I must say that...

375
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:59,166
The Royal Mint is difficult,
really difficult, but possible.

376
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,250
Even sensible.

377
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:02,708
But to break into the Bank of Spain...

378
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:06,083
is crazy...

379
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:09,291
and, most importantly, impossible.

380
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,708
- It may seem impossible...
- It is.

381
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,625
And this seeming impossibility

382
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:16,958
makes it very pretty.

383
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,375
It seems impossible, but...

384
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:24,083
Palermo, fill us in.

385
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,708
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Bank of Spain.

386
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,375
We go 10 meters under the floor, 20...

387
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:32,708
30...

388
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,250
40...

389
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:35,750
And here she is.

390
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,125
The vault.

391
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:42,000
Forty-eight meters underground.

392
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:45,750
The vault is completely airtight.

393
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:46,833
Why?

394
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,083
Because it can be flooded,
ladies and gentlemen.

395
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:51,875
Damn ingenious Spaniards.

396
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:54,375
You must be a perverse son of a bitch
to think that out!

397
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,750
- Show some respect.
- It's a compliment.

398
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:59,541
It's great. It's a masterpiece.

399
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:00,625
Unique in the world.

400
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:04,208
They channeled two streams
into the chamber with the gold.

401
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:06,916
Twenty-eight miles
of reinforced pipes underground.

402
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,583
- Why?
- So that in case someone

403
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:11,375
touches this door...

404
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:18,708
the chamber gets flooded
in less than 20 minutes.

405
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:21,458
You touch the gold,

406
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:25,583
and you explode like a toad,
you drown, man... A marvel!

407
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:31,666
Everything is so discouraging that
nobody expects anyone to try and break in.

408
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,625
That's why it'll be all right.

409
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,208
Actually, it's very simple.

410
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:39,833
If we use talent

411
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:41,208
and science.

412
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:43,916
The best minds in engineering...

413
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,125
in physics,

414
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:49,666
in fluid mechanics...
Can you imagine them preparing for a job?

415
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,458
Excellency applied to robbery.

416
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:53,791
But how on earth are you going in?

417
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,125
There is a unit of the Civil Guard,
20 private security guards.

418
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:01,208
The governor's bodyguards.
And the place has strategic importance.

419
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:03,333
The army would be there within minutes.

420
00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:06,625
It's hard to get in
if you're dressed as a thief, yes.

421
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:08,375
But, Sergio,

422
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:09,916
imagine there's chaos,

423
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:13,416
and you're the one everyone
is expecting to save the day.

424
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,333
And it's so easy to create chaos, brother.
Let me tell you...

425
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:22,250
they will greet us
with their arms wide open.

426
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,041
CIVIL GUARD

427
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:28,625
Captain Garrido,

428
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:31,083
First Squad, Sixth Company of BRIPAC.

429
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:32,291
Lieutenant Alcázar.

430
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:33,975
We're ordered to safeguard the building.

431
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,750
I want all those people out.

432
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:42,791
We need to widen the security perimeter
150 meters from the bank façade.

433
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,875
And open the back doors.
There's a convoy on the way.

434
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,500
Ladies, we're going in.

435
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,500
We've received orders to coordinate,

436
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:54,916
but not to allow a convoy to enter.

437
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,875
Sir, the convoy is approaching.

438
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,375
I shall not give that order to my men.

439
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:12,375
Stop that convoy.

440
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:19,166
<i>They're pulling us over, girls.</i>

441
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:22,416
Sir.

442
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,875
I request immediate entry.

443
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:27,916
Jiménez.

444
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:30,625
Give me your radio.

445
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,625
<i>Staff Headquarters.</i>

446
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:41,041
Lieutenant Alcázar speaking,
Civil Guard unit.

447
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,833
I urgently request access confirmation
for the BRIPAC squad

448
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:45,500
into the Bank of Spain.

449
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,791
What the fuck is going on?

450
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:58,000
<i>This is Lieutenant Colonel Castro.
Alert Level 5 has just been declared.</i>

451
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:00,000
<i>I repeat, Alert Level 5. From now on,</i>

452
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:03,833
the army will be in charge of the defense
within the Bank and its perimeter.

453
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:07,083
So, start coordinating your men
and follow Captain Garrido's orders

454
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:09,208
until Colonel Cerceda arrives,
do you copy?

455
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,750
Yes, sir. Understood.

456
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,416
Let's widen the security perimeter!

457
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:40,666
I want all those lowlifes
on the other side of the street.

458
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:51,875
Let's clear the area
until the squad arrives.

459
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,375
Get the tear gas ready!

460
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,416
And let's get the tear gas ready!

461
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,458
Let them in. Authorization confirmed.

462
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:25,625
Now we're finally in.

463
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,791
Do you know what aikido is?

464
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,333
Yes, an AC.

465
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:52,666
No, those shitty thin chocolate sticks:
neither a snack nor an appetizer.

466
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,333
Ai-ki-do.

467
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:57,916
Using the enemy's force to your advantage.

468
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,250
We alone can't break into
the Bank of Spain.

469
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,666
The enemy's force
is much greater than ours.

470
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,750
So...

471
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:07,083
we shall apply aikido.

472
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,208
How, aikido, Professor?

473
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:11,208
Whatever we're not able to do

474
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:13,541
will be done by the Civil Guard,

475
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:16,583
the Spanish Army
and the bank's private security.

476
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:21,416
<i>They will ensure that no one comes
closer than 150 meters from the building.</i>

477
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:25,416
We'll find out the exact number
of hostages in the building.

478
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,555
How many people are there in the building?

479
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,541
The security staff will provide
the numbers.

480
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,500
Three hundred and sixty-seven.

481
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:34,458
Aikido.

482
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:37,541
I want all 367 people here
in three minutes.

483
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:38,833
<i>We'll place charges</i>

484
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:42,666
on façades and windows, in broad daylight,
in the street and unseen. How?

485
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:46,250
Thanks to the smoke the Civil Guards
will throw to clear the crowd.

486
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:48,166
Aikido.

487
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,416
<i>Evacuation protocol.</i>

488
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,750
I want everyone down here
in three minutes.

489
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:29,041
Move!

490
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,958
<i>- This is not an evacuation drill.</i>
- Now.

491
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:32,041
<i>Evacuation protocol.</i>

492
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:34,541
We'll take the clients and employees
out of the building,

493
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,041
following a strict protocol.

494
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:37,708
How?

495
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:39,875
Let's proceed with the evacuation.

496
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:42,375
I want everyone down here right now!

497
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:48,875
Evacuation protocol.

498
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:50,250
Proceed in an orderly manner.

499
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,226
<i>The Civil Guards and the security staff
will raid the building,</i>

500
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,500
<i>office by office,</i>

501
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,875
and will evacuate everyone
in less than three minutes.

502
00:36:58,958 --> 00:36:59,958
Aikido!

503
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:01,791
Hurry up! Hurry up!

504
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:03,458
Hurry up! Hurry up!

505
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:09,541
Come on, hurry up!

506
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:12,458
They'll help us get in all the material
we'll need for the job.

507
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:19,625
Come on!

508
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:27,833
Come on!

509
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,416
Come on! Come on!

510
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,750
Please, I need you all to keep calm.

511
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:35,625
We will evacuate the building
in two groups:

512
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,166
Group 1 and Group 2.

513
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,125
And they will escort
the spare hostages out.

514
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:41,958
They will all leave together
and will rid us of a problem.

515
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:43,250
Aikido!

516
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:44,666
Group 1, out now!

517
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,750
- Don't move, don't move.
- Back off.

518
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:50,875
Come on.

519
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:54,291
Move forward, move forward! Go, go!

520
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:55,958
Move forward, move forward!

521
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:56,958
Go, go!

522
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:57,916
Move forward!

523
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,583
Don't stay there! Move!

524
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:00,875
Everyone out!

525
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,458
Don't stop moving!
Go to the end of the street!

526
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:05,833
Move, move!

527
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,125
Move!

528
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:09,041
Keep walking!

529
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:22,166
Move forward! Come on!

530
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,708
Move, madam!

531
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:25,041
<i>Then,</i>

532
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,875
when everyone is where they have to be,

533
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,125
we'll just need to push a button.

534
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:40,833
And I'll push...

535
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:43,041
<i>that button.</i>

536
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,958
There's no turning back.
