00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,040
Check-up call.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,000
- Everything is running smoothly over here.
- <i>Smoothly?</i>

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,560
Smoothly as in Tokyo being interrogated?

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,320
As in you're about to execute Rio?

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,760
<i>Berlin, what are you doing?</i>

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,080
Professor, it's Nairobi.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,680
<i>Berlin is indisposed. So
from now on, I'm in charge.</i>

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,200
Let the matriarchy begin.

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,520
<i>If we took a photo of this moment</i>

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,800
<i>it could be my last memory
of the Royal Mint of Spain.</i>

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,920
<i>Leaving a string of mistakes inside,</i>

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,480
<i>a weakened group,</i>

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,320
<i>and only one with the
guts to pull their weight:</i>

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
<i>Nairobi.</i>

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,200
What I mean, Professor, is
that this is out of control.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,640
<i>The situation is critical.</i>

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,000
Tokyo played Russian roulette
with Berlin tied to a chair.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,440
<i>Berlin turned her in.</i>

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,800
And then, Rio deserted

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,530
and Berlin almost executed him

22
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:24,360
like some fucking Vietnamese
firing squad.

23
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,080
Helsinki suffocated Oslo.

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,040
He killed him?

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,280
<i>He was a vegetal.</i>

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,000
<i>Helsinki says he would have wanted it.</i>

27
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,040
<i>As you can see, this
is a fucking disaster,</i>

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,640
so I have no choice but to take control

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,640
until things get back on track!

30
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,160
Ask him what the hell he
was doing with the police.

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,920
I was at the house in Toledo,
it was part of the plan.

32
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
<i>Professor,</i>

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,000
we need to know what situation we're in.

34
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,080
MONDAY 09:00 PM

35
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,840
There are some loose
ends, I'm not going to lie.

36
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,920
HOUR 83 OF THE HEIST

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,600
<i>I'd say it was the
biggest loose end of all.</i>

38
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,600
<i>Assistant Inspector Angel
had discovered the Professor.</i>

39
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,360
<i>He had his fingerprints</i>

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,120
<i>and was in a coma waiting
to wake up and reveal it.</i>

41
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,960
<i>The Professor was
living on borrowed time.</i>

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,200
<i>As was everyone else.</i>

43
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,360
The situation in there isn't
much better from what you say.

44
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
<i>Look,</i>

45
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,160
you do what you have to do,

46
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,440
I'll fix things in here in the meantime.

47
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,600
I'll put the call through,
probably from the tent.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Inspector.

49
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,840
Before I get to the point
I need to clarify something.

50
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,680
<i>What do I call you now?</i>

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,440
<i>Professor?</i>

52
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,080
<i>Sergio? Or... </i>

53
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,520
<i>Mr. Marquina?</i>

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,960
I'll always be the Professor to you.

55
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,960
That's how we met.

56
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,840
<i>You'll always be
Inspector Murillo to me,</i>

57
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,960
<i>even if you become my executioner.</i>

58
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,760
Remember the first time you made love?

59
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,760
Of course. One doesn't forget that.

60
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,880
Well, this is my first time

61
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,560
in the world of crime.

62
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,120
And no matter what, I will always

63
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,360
remember it fondly.

64
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,680
<i>You're an enthusiast.</i>

65
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,400
And this world needs people like you.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I hope that when you get out of prison

67
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,240
<i>you'll help the country progress.</i>

68
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,640
Because the truth is that...

69
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,440
<i>Where did it happen?</i>

70
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
What?

71
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,240
The first time you made love.

72
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,760
In a tent.

73
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
<i>That's wonderful.</i>

74
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,880
That's a good place for a first time.

75
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,240
The sounds of the
countryside, the lights...

76
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,400
Yes, that was right.

77
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,000
The rest was, let's say...

78
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,520
experimental and...

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
brief.

80
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,600
Okay, Professor.

81
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,520
I'm calling to inform
you that Silene Oliveira

82
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,360
<i>is going into provisional
custody without bail tonight.</i>

83
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,720
What did she say to make you angry

84
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,920
and skip the 72-hour custody?

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
She was trying to be smart.

86
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,240
There's something I don't get.

87
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,720
<i>Why do you let go of your
people instead of the hostages?</i>

88
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,800
There have been
discrepancies in the group.

89
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,120
- Nothing else.
- You're against the ropes.

90
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,680
<i>- And you know it.</i>
- I admit you're winning,

91
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,240
but this is only one battle.

92
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,520
<i>It's nothing compared to the war.</i>

93
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,960
He still teases you,
with a riot on his hands?

94
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,760
He's a rock star.

95
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,320
<i>Salva, how are you doing?</i>

96
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,160
How are you holding up?

97
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Well...

98
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,360
I never thought tying my
shoelaces could be this painful.

99
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,280
Those bruises could use some care.

100
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,000
A nurse.

101
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,480
That's a very suggestive proposal.

102
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,760
I'd love to look after you, but...

103
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,120
It would have to be at my place.
I want to see my daughter and...

104
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,640
<i>I know that's not the
most romantic date.</i>

105
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,800
I can't think of a better date.

106
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Okay.

107
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,080
<i>When you spend years
obsessing about something,</i>

108
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
<i>that something</i>

109
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,800
<i>is your whole world.</i>

110
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,400
<i>A perfect world.</i>

111
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,200
<i>But now the plan was not
only the Professor's.</i>

112
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,560
<i>It belonged to all of us.</i>

113
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,040
<i>And we were all screwing it up.</i>

114
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,160
<i>For once, the Professor
felt weakened.</i>

115
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,480
<i>And crawling into Raquel's arms
seemed like the best refuge.</i>

116
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,840
<i>The only one possible.</i>

117
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,840
Now you're a hostage too.

118
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,440
What's the matter?

119
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,560
They tried to kill me.

120
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,360
They almost did.

121
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,160
Why did they want to kill you?

122
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,080
They turned Tokyo in.

123
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,280
I was going to turn myself in too.

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Alison!

125
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,080
Leave her.

126
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,720
She's lost her mind!

127
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,400
If Tokyo shows up, who
knows what could happen.

128
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,240
You heard him, she's been kicked out.

129
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,200
This could actually be good.

130
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,680
- Good for what?
- To get out, damn it!

131
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,240
For good!

132
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,480
Is it that hard to understand?

133
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,320
They have locked up our colleagues

134
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,680
when they had promised them freedom!

135
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,160
Some of us have been truly humiliated.

136
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,360
They've ruined my relationship

137
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,640
and my future paternity.

138
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,480
And regarding the money
that they promised us,

139
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,360
it's all a lie.

140
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,960
A fucking sham!

141
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,840
He confirmed it!

142
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,920
How long are we going
to stay and do nothing?

143
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
The thieves are weakened now.

144
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,520
No one can argue. And if we
don't seize this opportunity,

145
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,200
we'll be letting them escape.
We have to finish them off!

146
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,800
Muster up all the dignity, the courage,

147
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:25,200
the wild animal we carry inside!

148
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
We must do something.

149
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,240
I don't know...

150
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,200
steal a gun from them.

151
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
What?

152
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,120
What are you saying?

153
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,720
Where are we going to get a gun?

154
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,480
Swapping one of theirs for a fake one.

155
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,240
If you manage to get
one of the fake weapons

156
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,960
you could swap it.

157
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,720
Then one of them will be unarmed

158
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,560
and one of you armed.

159
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Oh, hello, dear.

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,240
- Mom, what are you doing here this late?
- Mommy!

161
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,240
Sweetheart.

162
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Come here.

163
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
Come here.

164
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,240
But wait a minute.

165
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,840
Tell me, what are you doing up so late?

166
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,880
I wanted to see you before going to bed.

167
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,040
Me too, baby.

168
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
Hi.

169
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
Hello.

170
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,760
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've made dinner.

171
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,200
You came for dinner, right?

172
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,480
Yes. Dinner and sleep, actually.

173
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
Right?

174
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Are you dating?

175
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Oh, dear.

176
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Well, uh.

177
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,480
Yes, right?

178
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Kind of.

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,280
But have you asked her?

180
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,480
Actually, I haven't. But...

181
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,360
we kissed, which is...

182
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,000
almost the same.

183
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,880
- Okay.
- Come on, Paulita. Let's go.

184
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,120
You have school tomorrow.

185
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,360
No, don't worry.

186
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
I'll tuck her in.

187
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Thank you.

188
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,240
Did you really hit him?

189
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Well...

190
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
yes, I did.

191
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,200
It infuriated me to think he'd hurt you.

192
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,720
I don't like violence. Never have.

193
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,800
I know it's wrong and
you can defend yourself.

194
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,320
- It's not my bussiness, but...
- Salva.

195
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,720
I'm glad you hit the
jerk of my ex-husband.

196
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,240
I should have done it myself.

197
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,760
Even if it's wrong to say so.

198
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Well...

199
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,880
sometimes what's wrong is...

200
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,640
the only choice.

201
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,240
I'm speaking from experience.

202
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,960
I'm glad you're here.

203
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,200
Okay from now on I need
everybody closing bags.

204
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,960
- Non-stop!
- You won't mention the lies?

205
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,680
Arturo, drop the Gandhi crap

206
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,840
or you'll eat shit for
breakfast, lunch and dinner.

207
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,400
Besides, I guarantee you
that I haven't lied to anyone.

208
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,680
Nairobi is in charge now.
So everyone get packing!

209
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,000
Nairobi has a heavy hand for a woman.

210
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,120
Berlin, we're sinking.

211
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,640
The most important thing
is to get out of here alive

212
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,760
without making any more mistakes.

213
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,280
You tell me. Are you with me...

214
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
or against me?

215
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,160
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

216
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,960
- catch a tiger by the toe.
- A tiger by the toe.

217
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Well, I'm going with you, Nairobi.

218
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
Until the end.

219
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,240
I'm going to abide by your coup.

220
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,840
And I'll even confess
that I am turned on

221
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,360
by the idea of serving
a woman who is a goddess.

222
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,520
You better pray to this goddess,

223
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,160
because she's got your
morphine. Don't forget.

224
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,840
That's the office where
they keep the fake guns.

225
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,400
- So?
- So one of us has to get in there

226
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,120
and take a blank gun.

227
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,800
And which one of them
will you switch with?

228
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,440
Denver.

229
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,840
He's the dumbest one.

230
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,440
- And who will take his gun?
- Must be Monica.

231
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,000
- When he calls her in for treatment.
- And why would she do it?

232
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,120
It's a suicidal risk.

233
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,520
Because that thug shot her.

234
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,920
He's got her in a den

235
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,440
and he took advantage of
her fear and desperation

236
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,440
to screw her a few times.

237
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,480
And apparently now he left you.

238
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Yes.

239
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,600
But that's what happens.

241
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,280
Sometimes we want to change our lives.

242
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,080
We get our hopes up.

243
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,240
But no heist man will take you with him.

244
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Fine.

245
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,640
I'll go get the gun.

246
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,160
Do you have copies of the office key?

247
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
No.

248
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,160
What is Plan Chernobyl?

249
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,000
Plan Chernobyl is a...

250
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,920
desperate but beautiful plan.

251
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,560
Consists in releasing the
cash in balloons from the roof,

252
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,120
popping the balloons with gunfire
and causing some wonderful rain.

253
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,240
- Calling the media, radio, television...
- Like the Christmas Pageant parade,

254
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,520
but with 50 euro bills.

255
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,320
That's Plan Chernobyl?

256
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,212
Thousands of people picking up the dough,

257
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,640
spreading chaos
among the police. Imagine.

258
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,080
A billion euros rain.

259
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
Right.

260
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,800
And us vanishing
amongst the frenzied mob.

261
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Very nice.

262
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,480
You know the Professor, an idealist.

263
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,720
He cares more about the
message than the money.

264
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,600
And I didn't say it because
we must respect the timing.

265
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,240
Wish me luck.

266
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,800
Mr. Torres, in my office!

267
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,360
Come in, Mr Torres.

268
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Let's see...

269
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,000
could we increase the printing rate?

270
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,760
Well, it's possible.

271
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,040
But it would be very risky.

272
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,720
If it gets stuck,

273
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,120
it would take us three
to four hours to fix it.

274
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,160
Calculate the production rate increase.

275
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,840
Okay, Miss Nairobi.

276
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
Mr. Arturo.

277
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,960
Get up, Torres. God damn it, get up!

278
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,760
What are you doing?

279
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,280
None of your bussiness.
Act like I'm not here.

280
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,840
Walk to the door and don't lock it.

281
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,320
I'm sorry, but I'll have to report you.

282
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,560
If they find out I've
seen you, I'm done for too.

283
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Look...

284
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,240
idiot!

285
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
I have a gun.

286
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,160
Don't you dare report me

287
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,320
or you'll be the first to go. Okay?

288
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Excuse me, Mr. Arturo, but
that's one of the fake guns.

289
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,600
You left the bag open.

290
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
Listen to me.

291
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,800
Listen because I won't say it again.

292
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,480
When all this is over,

293
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,040
and it will be in a
couple of hours, at best,

294
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,600
you're going to come back

295
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,840
to your crappy job.

296
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,960
And I'll be waiting for you the next day

297
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,394
with a fat layoff

298
00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:43,760
and a disciplinary file that
will make you shit yourself.

299
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,720
You'll be fucked up until you retire.

300
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
Okay?

301
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,040
You have three daughters, right?

302
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,760
And two of them have
been unemployed for...

303
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,240
seven years, if I recall correctly.

304
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
So it's up to you.

305
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,320
Torres.

306
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,520
- Miss Nairobi.
- What is it?

307
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,560
We would increase production
by two million every hour.

308
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,320
Do it.

309
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,920
And the technical stops
will be every six hours.

310
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,680
Because that's an extra two million.

311
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Very well.

312
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,080
I'll get this off the
ground. Mark my words.

313
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,440
Anything troubling you?

314
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
No.

315
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,080
I'm worried it's been
the best night of my life.

316
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
Salva.

317
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,160
You've already won me
over, no need to exaggerate.

318
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
It's true.

319
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,160
But I wasn't planning on
it. I hadn't anticipated it.

320
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Oh, you hadn't anticipated it?

321
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,840
Do you anticipate everything?

322
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,480
Well, let's say...

323
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,640
I'm a man who...

324
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,760
picks out the clothes he's
going to wear the day before.

325
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,600
A man who became obsessed...

326
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
with...

327
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,840
making the best cider in the world.

328
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,640
And...

329
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,960
and I studied it all.

330
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,320
Acidity, fermentation...

331
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,600
Every possible reaction
of each ingredient.

332
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Year...

333
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,440
after year, after year.

334
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,400
And you can get one bad apple...

335
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,440
that ruins the whole barrel.

336
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,720
Salva, you're really
into cider, aren't you?

337
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,200
It was my father's dream.

338
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,080
And...

339
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,400
he died before he could fulfill it.

340
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
He...

341
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,320
He wanted to make...

342
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,280
twenty four hundred barrels.

343
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,280
I understand the homage but...

344
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,720
Why don't you make half?

345
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,760
Or half of half,

346
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
and then...

347
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,520
focus on your own dreams?

348
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Let's go away.

349
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,520
I wrap up this cider
thing in a few days,

350
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,160
and we'll go to the Caribbean.

351
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,400
Well, I...

352
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,640
I don't have the cider,

353
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,280
but I have a mother, a daughter,

354
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,120
- and a heist to solve.
- Well, we take your mother...

355
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,880
and your daughter with us.

356
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,960
Can you imagine raising your
daughter on a sunny beach?

357
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Raquel...

358
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,920
I don't want this to wear off.

359
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,600
I don't want to ignore this...

360
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,520
this desire to feel alive that
I've never felt so strongly.

361
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,400
You would cross the ocean with a mother,

362
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,440
a daughter and a grandmother?

363
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,600
Right now, I would.

364
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,680
I have a plan B.

365
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,000
Damn.

366
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,720
It's so crazy...

367
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
that...

368
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,280
I can't imagine myself
doing anything else.

369
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,120
Finish with the heist.
Do what you have to do.

370
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,240
And then we go.

371
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,080
Okay.

372
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,280
Okay.

373
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,720
Everyone listen up!

374
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,600
We're going to solve
this heist in 24 hours

375
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,560
and get back to our lives.
We've neglected them enough.

376
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,640
Suarez.

377
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,440
Call Chief Sanchez.

378
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,080
I won't let anyone else get
killed, destroyed, or caught.

379
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,200
Nairobi, listen. Coming
as far as you have is epic.

380
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,800
I give you my most
sincere congratulations.

381
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,840
<i>Listen, I'm going to
get you out of there.</i>

382
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,680
Before they catch you all.

383
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,800
Get Lobo and the rest of the UCO here.

384
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,200
What do you have in mind?

385
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,720
I'm starting to think
that the man outside

386
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,120
is the real brains of the operation.

387
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,360
He drew a trail of clues to
lead us to the estate in Toledo.

388
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,160
But I think I know how to catch him.

389
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,000
First, we'll get the
hostages out of the basement.

390
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,360
Thank you. We don't have enough
people to guard the hostages.

391
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,240
Besides, we promised them
freedom. So let them have it.

392
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,960
We'll release them, but give me an hour.

393
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,720
It's a very big spectacle
for such a small audience.

394
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,320
Hi.

395
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,840
I'm going to release 11 hostages,

396
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,080
<i>under one condition.</i>

397
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,720
I want a reporter and a camera
to cover the news from the inside.

398
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,040
<i>Live news feed.</i>

399
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
Look,

400
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,880
I'd love to help with
your propaganda but...

401
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,680
I can't force any
civilian to go in there.

402
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,640
- <i> You know that very well.</i>
- True.

403
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,760
You're right, Inspector.

404
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,400
You don't have to force anyone.
Just suggest it. I'm sure

405
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,680
many reporters will volunteer
for an interview like that.

406
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,440
- I'll think about it. <i>
- Of course.</i>

407
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,920
Think about it.

408
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,080
But remember I record these
conversations and the last time

409
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,760
<i>you refused to release hostages... </i>

410
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,880
it wasn't taken very well by the public.

411
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,440
But, of course, take your time.

412
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,240
Son of a bitch.

413
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,240
Let's talk about something
else. How can I explain...

414
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,640
- Do you like soccer?
- Oh, yes, soccer.

415
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,080
Professor, in my country soccer is big.

416
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,400
Well, imagine a soccer match.

417
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,840
- Again with soccer?
- Nairobi, listen.

418
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,160
A match in the World Cup.

419
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,840
And Brazil is playing against Cameroon.

420
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,040
- Who wins?
- Easy!

421
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
Or rather...

422
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,680
who do you want to win?

423
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,240
I'd say Brazil wins.

424
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,200
But I'd root for Cameroon.

425
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,080
- Cameroon.
- Yes.

426
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,320
Cameroon, for sure.

427
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,480
- Cameroon, all the way.
- Look,

428
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,040
by instinct, human beings always,

429
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,720
always sides with the weaker one.

430
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,680
The underdog.

431
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,040
So if we show the world our weaknesses,

432
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,720
our wounds,

433
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,720
that we are on the verge

434
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
of surrendering.

435
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,360
It will produce a...

436
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,720
a shudder.

437
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,640
I think any guy who isn't
Brazilian would go for Cameroon.

438
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,600
- Even some Brazilian guys.
- Or Brazilian girls.

439
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,920
Yes, or Brazilian girls.

440
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,960
Okay, gentlemen. To Cameroon!

441
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,120
How does that soccer chant go?

442
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,040
Cameroon, Cameroon, Cameroon!

443
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,680
Cameroon, Cameroon, Cameroon!

444
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,200
Cameroon!

445
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,960
We move on to plan Cameroon.

446
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,480
We'll release the
hostages in the basement.

447
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,720
And we're going to get a reporter
and a camera to record it.

448
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,760
We'll need someone to be interviewed.

449
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,320
And my suggestion is you, Rio.

450
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,120
I understand your anger,

451
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,160
but we need you. You
can do it without a mask,

452
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
you're empathetic.

453
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,160
You think I'll go out on TV?

454
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,160
For Tokyo to see me from jail,

455
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,920
with a big smile,

456
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,120
doing an interview as if
nothing had fucking happened.

457
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,480
Now I'm a hostage.

458
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,720
Don't count on me for anything.

459
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,960
Fuck it, I'll do it.

460
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,560
I'm a natural crybaby, you
can tell just by looking.

461
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,360
You're no crybaby. You make others cry.

462
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I'll do it.

463
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,800
If I don't have to talk
too much, I'll do it.

464
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,760
You could, but no.

465
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,320
No.

466
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,360
I'll do it with a mask.

467
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,080
With a mask?

468
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,240
On a live interview?

469
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,160
What are we now? ETA?

470
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,360
Jihadists?

471
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
No, no.

472
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,160
This interview has to be done

473
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,720
open-faced.

474
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,560
So all of Spain can feel our eyes,

475
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,360
our breath. So that they
can understand the pain

476
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,560
and a little bit of the sorrow.

477
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,280
Right.

478
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,400
You want to do it.

479
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,240
But you know what the problem is?

480
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,920
If there's someone who I've
never seen feel pain or sorrow

481
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,720
it's you, Berlin.

482
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
Tokyo's gone.

483
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,000
Rio doesn't want to do it.

484
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,680
Don't look down on someone
who's good at his job, Nairobi.

485
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,120
I can be a good master of ceremonies.

486
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
He's right.

487
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,360
He's good at acting.

488
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
Very well.

489
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,840
You'll do it.

490
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,560
HOSPITAL BLUEPRINTS ENTRANCE

491
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,360
An interview in exchange
for releasing 11 hostages.

492
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,440
I don't know.

493
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,440
It's more justifiable.

494
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,360
We'll be criticized on every front,

495
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,880
but we have to accept it.

496
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,400
Let's take the credit and sell
it as a display of transparency.

497
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,520
You can sell it however you like.
But what about the other thing?

498
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,600
The operation you want
to set up in the hospital.

499
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,240
In exchange for what? On what evidence?

500
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,080
A plate of fresh anchovies?

501
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,280
On the evidence that
they have a guy outside

502
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,800
who keeps messing with us.

503
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,080
Angel caught him, and
they tried to kill him.

504
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,000
- It was no accident.
- Inspector, we all

505
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,520
read the forensic
report on the accident.

506
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,440
And there's no evidence
of an attempted homicide.

507
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,080
Don't forget he was
driving under the influence.

508
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,560
Fine. You want evidence?

509
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,240
Let's set up the operation.

510
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,560
Let me leak to the press that Angel,
the only one who knows who he is,

511
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,120
will wake up from his
coma. And I guarantee you,

512
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,880
before five in the afternoon,

513
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,680
he will be in the hospital to kill him.

514
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But we'll be there to catch
him like cat and mouse.

515
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,440
Are you asking me to fill a hospital

516
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,160
with undercover agents,
like some police comic strip?

517
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,000
We should focus our
efforts on the factory.

518
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,200
What about the reporters?

519
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,880
What if they end up hostages too?

520
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,760
That interview is a smokescreen.

521
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,560
A trick to make us waste time.

522
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,760
Chief. Let's, for once,

523
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,720
be the ones who set the trap.

524
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,000
Can't you do it with ten?

525
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,720
Twenty.

526
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,760
Monica Gaztambide,
you're up for treatment.

527
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
Let's go.

528
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,240
If you take off the jumpsuit,
maybe I can treat you.

529
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,240
Can you turn around?

530
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,960
Since we're not together anymore, right?

531
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,080
No problem.

532
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Can I?

533
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,080
Wait.

534
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
Now.

535
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
How's the wound?

536
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
It hurts a lot.

537
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,680
And it stings.

538
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,120
We'll get only one
chance. I want him alive.

539
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,880
No one fires unless
under extreme danger.

540
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,320
First thing we'll do

541
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,840
is taking Angel to some place safe.

542
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,880
To do this, we'll set up a
room on a different floor.

543
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,480
Once we've moved him, we'll
leak the news of his recovery.

544
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,720
And the target will soon be on the move.

545
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,320
It will be essential that
everyone is in position.

546
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,760
<i>I want everyone to get
deep into their role.</i>

547
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,520
This is a very complex operation,

548
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,280
so we'll need extreme concentration.

549
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,720
<i>We'll have access to the
surveillance cameras.</i>

550
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,880
I don't want anyone from
security on the floor.

551
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,400
Not even hospital security.

552
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,320
No police cars in the vicinity either.

553
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,320
We'll roll out the fucking
red carpet into Angel's room,

554
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,640
where Lobo will be waiting instead.

555
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,480
And Agent Balmaseda will
take Mari Carmen's place.

556
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,360
They'll be there, ready
for a welcome surprise.

557
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,320
And remember, we're looking
for a middle-aged male.

558
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,720
You'll be 20 agents and he'll be alone.

559
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,520
He won't escape.

560
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Did you do it?

561
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,120
It's loaded!

562
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It's loaded.

563
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,240
Stop packing the bills
and stash what you can.

564
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,920
We're out of here!

565
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Stash them.

566
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,560
Quick!

567
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,960
We're going now. This
has lasted too long.

568
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,200
Piece of crap.

569
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Let's go.

570
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,720
Fifth day of the heist.

571
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,000
<i>One hostage and two officers wounded,</i>

572
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,720
<i>an explosion,</i>

573
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,480
<i>hostages escaped,</i>

574
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,640
<i>and now Channel 6 cameras
are about to enter the place</i>

575
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,680
<i>that the whole world is watching.</i>

576
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,600
<i>Reporters heading for the entrance.</i>

577
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,960
<i>We must remember the historical impact</i>

578
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,440
<i>of this moment.</i>

579
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,280
<i>TV channels from all over the world
are broadcasting our signal... </i>

580
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,440
Cover them until securing entry.

581
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,720
<i>... the first time a TV
crew goes live on... </i>

582
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,120
<i>They're opening the
doors. Attention escorts,</i>

583
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,000
stop at the bottom of
the stairs as requested.

584
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,680
<i>... special at the Royal Mint
of Spain. A crucial moment.</i>

585
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,000
<i>In a minute, we'll
witness something historic</i>

586
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,280
<i>A Channel 6 reporter and cameraman
will enter the site of the heist.</i>

587
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,280
<i>This is as far as the police
can go. From this point on</i>

588
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,800
<i>the reporters will be on
their own, unprotected.</i>

589
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,050
<i>We've never seen such a thing. </i>

590
00:39:34,051 --> 00:39:37,000
<i>All over the country, streets are empty.</i>

591
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,760
Return to your posts.

592
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,040
Good morning.

593
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,320
- Good morning.
- I'm Andres de Fonollosa.

594
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,120
Thank you for being here.

595
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,840
Can you put this on, please?

596
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,560
<i>We're already receiving the
signal. We're going live... </i>

597
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,800
- Raquel. <i>
- ... inside the factory.</i>

598
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,520
<i>Mr. Fonollosa, I have to ask why
did you allow a team of journalists</i>

599
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,720
<i>to broadcast live from here.</i>

600
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,520
<i>This is a decisive moment
for all of us in here and... </i>

601
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,720
we needed you here to record
it and to make it public.

602
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,840
Please, come with me. This way.

603
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,120
<i>That's Andres de Fonollosa,</i>

604
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,920
<i>a familiar face to the police.</i>

605
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,560
<i>Bank robber, informer, and
convicted for human trafficking.</i>

606
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,960
These are the 11 hostages

607
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,760
that are going to be released.

608
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
There they are.

609
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
I recognize

610
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,240
Manuel GarcÃ­a,

611
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,160
Alfonso MartÃ­nez,

612
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,640
and MarÃ­a Cornejo.

613
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,280
Looks like they will let them go.

614
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,640
<i>We're all nervous... </i>

615
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,160
Medical services ready.

616
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,240
<i>... like kids waiting for
the school bell to ring.</i>

617
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,960
I want to thank you all.

618
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,520
For the courage and bravery...

619
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,640
you have shown.

620
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
And...

621
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,000
and you, especially.

622
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,480
You and your child.

623
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,440
You've proven to be a strong woman.

624
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,240
Why have you decided

625
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
now,

626
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,840
after five days of captivity,

627
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,680
<i>to release hostages?</i>

628
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
<i>Five days?</i>

629
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,960
<i>It's hard to believe it's been</i>

630
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,240
a few days, isn't it?

631
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You see...

632
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,560
We confess that this is
a very hard time for us.

633
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,360
<i>The situation is critical.</i>

634
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,920
<i>We have no other option
but to surrender.</i>

635
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,760
<i>That's why you're here.</i>

636
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,440
This gesture is the beginning
of the end for everyone.

637
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,280
Helsinki,

638
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
it's time.

639
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,640
You can go.

640
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Thank you.

641
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,280
Snipers ready.

642
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,520
Assault Team 1, keep your distance.

643
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,840
Copy that.

644
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,680
We'll release hostages
in order to negociate

645
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,680
the conditions for our surrender.

646
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,800
<i>Have you decided to surrender?</i>

647
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,280
<i>We are aware that we lost.</i>

648
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,160
Open the doors!

649
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,680
<i>Eleven released. We're
watching it live...</i>

650
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,920
They're coming out.

651
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,880
<i>At last, good news at the Mint Factory.</i>

652
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,680
<i>There they are.</i>

653
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,840
<i>It's an exciting moment. It seems
like the heist men are giving in.</i>

654
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,640
<i>But there are more headlines, big ones.</i>

655
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,200
<i>Fonollosa has admitted that
the situation is critical,</i>

656
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,720
<i>that they have no
alternative but to surrender.</i>

657
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,320
<i>His literal words were:</i>

658
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,480
<i>"This is the beginning of the end,</i>

659
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,320
<i>and we are aware that we lost".</i>

660
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,720
I don't know if you've
ever seen a corpse.

661
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,960
For some of us it's also a first.

662
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,480
<i>You've come here to tell the truth.</i>

663
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,840
<i>Here it is. This is the truth.</i>

664
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,920
<i>We've been beaten.</i>

665
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,360
<i>We've been defeated.</i>

666
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,920
<i>It's important that you confirm it,</i>

667
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,320
<i>please.</i>

668
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
<i>Yes.</i>

669
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,880
<i>He doesn't have a pulse. He's dead.</i>

670
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,240
The hostages who escaped
hit him in the head.

671
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,560
He died within a few hours.

672
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,680
Maybe to the people out there,

673
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,480
this man is just a thief.

674
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,000
But to us, he was a
companion and a friend.

675
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,960
Nobody prepares you for that.

676
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,880
Nobody. It's one of the reasons why

677
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,480
<i>we decided to release hostages.</i>

678
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,680
<i>Some of us here thought we weren't
going to make it out alive.</i>

679
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,520
<i>But I never thought it would be him.</i>

680
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,840
You mean, there were
people in the group...

681
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,840
willing to sacrifice themselves?

682
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,320
No.

683
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,400
No.

684
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,720
Not at all. We're simple people.

685
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,840
We have gone through hardship

686
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,880
of all kinds.

687
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,360
Like anyone else.

688
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,080
Including terminal
illness. And we have had to

689
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,320
take desperate actions
like these in order to

690
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,360
leave something for our families.

691
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,640
For our loved ones.

692
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,200
As a matter of fact,

693
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,880
I have a degenerative disease
called Hellmer's myopathy.

694
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,160
The police knew it.

695
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,720
<i>That didn't stop them from
spreading lies about me.</i>

696
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,320
<i>I'll tell you something,
I may be a thief... </i>

697
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,280
<i>I have always been. I've
robbed banks, jewelry stores,</i>

698
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:43,000
<i>I've broken into mansions.
But I have never sold anyone.</i>

699
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,320
I've never sold a woman.

700
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,160
I'm not a pimp

701
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,000
who traffics.

702
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,480
Or rapes minors.

703
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,520
I'm not.

704
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,720
Ask the police, when you leave,
in which files are these cases.

705
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,600
You mean the police
have lied to the public?

706
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,800
The police lie!

707
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,640
They lie to the public!

708
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,480
They've lied to my friends.

709
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,720
They've soiled my family name.

710
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,800
I'm a thief.

711
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,800
But I have every right in
the world not to be defamed.

712
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,160
I have the same right as anyone

713
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,000
to die in peace.

714
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,040
With dignity.

715
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,560
I can't go on. Cut.

716
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,840
Please, cut.

717
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,160
<i>That morning we were a
trending topic worldwide.</i>

718
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,960
<i>People went silent</i>

719
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,520
<i>in cafeterias and in taxis.</i>

720
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,720
<i>Fonollosa says the police are lying.</i>

721
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,360
That they have been lying about his past.

722
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,920
<i>And dares them to come
up with legal files.</i>

723
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,160
<i>We were the Cameroon team
barefoot against Brazil.</i>

724
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,440
<i>And everyone was rooting for us.</i>

725
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,640
<i>We're now going to our news colleagues,
Cristina Saavedra. Go ahead.</i>

726
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,240
<i>Breaking news: Deputy
Inspector Ãngel Rubio</i>

727
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,680
<i>could wake from his coma.</i>

728
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,720
<i>He was kept in an induced
coma after a car accident.</i>

729
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,640
<i>The Deputy Inspector suffered
an accident on road M-506</i>

730
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,320
<i>when his car crashed
into a construction booth</i>

731
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,240
<i>in one of the lanes, causing
it to roll over multiple times.</i>

732
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,280
Professor, <i>did you see us on TV?</i>

733
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,680
Nairobi, I want you all to
be one, like a rowing team.

734
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,000
Tell Rio that, as captain of the ship,

735
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,120
I'll get Tokyo out of
jail no matter what.

736
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,880
Yes, sir. That's more like it!

737
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,240
Put Berlin on.

738
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,560
Berlin.

739
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,720
Me?

740
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,520
Yes, you.

741
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,360
Thank you.

742
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,600
Hello?

743
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,840
Deputy Inspector Rubio
is waking from his coma.

744
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,520
What are the odds of that being true?

745
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I don't know.

746
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,600
That's elementary police work:

747
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,480
saying he's waking from
his coma to lure you in.

748
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,160
That doesn't even work on sitcoms.

749
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,600
And what if it's not?

750
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,040
He's the only one who knows
who I am. The only loose end.

751
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,680
What room did they put him in?

752
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,560
<i>Room 119.</i>

753
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,400
It's a trap.

754
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,840
Yes.

755
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,840
There's a 90 per cent
chance it's a trap.

756
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,920
<i>Ninety nine percent chance.</i>

757
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,040
Ninety nine percent.

758
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,920
But are we going to leave
one percent to chance?

759
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,880
No, you'll have to make
sure. And if it isn't a trap,

760
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,760
<i>finish him off.</i>

761
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,040
Enter a hospital

762
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,080
in which, surely, there'll be 50
police officers waiting for me?

763
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,760
<i>Sergio, think, damn it.</i>

764
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,720
You spent half your
childhood in a hospital.

765
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,040
How do you walk into a
trap and not get caught,

766
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,400
<i>knowing that the cavalry
is waiting for you?</i>

767
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,480
That would be

768
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,600
by making the cavalry

769
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,960
run away.
