﻿1
00:00:11,307 --> 00:00:13,559
We will make a check call every six hours.

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,470
Third unanswered call.

3
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:17,729
We have not heard from the professor for 18 hours.

4
00:00:17,753 --> 00:00:19,939
The Professor will be solving some pending issues.

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,377
- We are in a critical situation. - No, we'll be in a critical situation,

6
00:00:23,406 --> 00:00:25,963
if the Professor does not call within 6 hours.

7
00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:28,073
In this case we will activate the Chernobyl plan.

8
00:00:28,074 --> 00:00:30,061
I want you to find all the estates ...

9
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:32,902
within a radius of 100 kilometers from the pharmacy of Palomeque.

10
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:36,719
If they bought the medicines there, it means that they were close by.

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,120
Inspector, we found the property.

12
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,589
You have to scour every single corner of this house.

13
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:49,095
All the plan, fuck. Hours, photos, programs.

14
00:00:50,086 --> 00:00:51,646
It makes no sense.

15
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,309
- Call Alberto. - Your ex-husband?

16
00:00:53,322 --> 00:00:55,201
Is not it the best of the scientific? So, come on.

17
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:58,751
- Hi, Raquel. - He is Salva, my current companion.

18
00:00:58,752 --> 00:01:01,735
- Salvador Martín, pleasure. - My pleasure.

19
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:03,466
All this stuff is worthless.

20
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:05,443
Ángel has arrived farther than you with the footprints he has found.

21
00:01:05,444 --> 00:01:06,222
Which footprints?

22
00:01:06,237 --> 00:01:08,203
He had recovered a personal object, a teaspoon.

23
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:10,938
Ángel picked up some of the gang or otherwise went near.

24
00:01:11,256 --> 00:01:12,737
They stopped the Professor.

25
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:15,296
They are questioning him at the door of the house in Toledo.

26
00:01:15,318 --> 00:01:16,835
They have the professor.

27
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:20,389
There will be no tunnel to the hangar because we will find GEOs waiting for us.

28
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:23,376
- Which of you still believe in the Professor? - I believe in the Professor.

29
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:24,613
- Rio? - I believe what I see.

30
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:26,596
- Moscow? - I keep counting on the Professor.

31
00:01:26,597 --> 00:01:28,316
I vote to leave here, right away.

32
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:32,117
I have good reasons to be on the side of the Professor.

33
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:33,176
I'm on the side of Berlin.

34
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,101
Are you sure you want to do it?

35
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:37,748
He was your father.

36
00:01:37,843 --> 00:01:39,254
It is the only thing that matters.

37
00:01:39,653 --> 00:01:41,248
We will do it for him.

38
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:42,867
If there's something useful here, I know where it is.

39
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:44,912
All they wanted to eliminate seriously ...

40
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:46,955
they will have burned him in here.

41
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:49,247
It's the safest way to destroy something ...

42
00:01:49,252 --> 00:01:50,670
that's what we all would do.

43
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:53,726
- Raquel, I do not want to disturb, but ... - I bring this to the central Canillas.

44
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,844
I really had to go to Madrid, I would have taken the bus.

45
00:01:57,897 --> 00:02:00,634
- Am I a bit 'upside down? - Do you want me to stop?

46
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:02,579
If you do not mind, I would be grateful.

47
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,981
I was thinking back to what you said before ...

48
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:11,971
to the fact that you wish the best of Raquel.

49
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,519
If so, you do not ...

50
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:16,360
he discovered his sister.

51
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:18,574
- Piece of shit. - Get out of the car.

52
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,692
You are under arrest for assault on a public official.

53
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:35,965
Listen to me.

54
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,724
I have to ask you a favor...

55
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:40,114
when the mess breaks up, you'll have to deliver.

56
00:02:40,136 --> 00:02:42,309
- Rio. - When things get complicated ...

57
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,684
I'll be by your side ...

58
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:45,087
what happens happens.

59
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:52,742
Give me the revolver.

60
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,840
Tell us about the Chernobyl plan.

61
00:02:58,205 --> 00:03:00,613
I'm the only one in here who knows the plan.

62
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:04,521
You will not have the slightest idea how to get out of this fucking trap.

63
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,443
What do you want to do with me?

64
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,504
Son of a bitch, I hate you.

65
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:54,268
Why must it be the end of something?

66
00:03:55,697 --> 00:03:58,064
It could not be the beginning ...

67
00:03:58,523 --> 00:04:01,000
of a wonderful friendship?

68
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
No!

69
00:04:31,742 --> 00:04:34,689
Beware, it looks like a hostage. We await orders.

70
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,167
We are approaching.

71
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:39,077
He looks like one of the robbers.

72
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:42,840
Got it.

73
00:04:51,898 --> 00:04:53,519
Who is it? I do not see the face.

74
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:56,100
It's Oliveira, sir.

75
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:15,547
We took it, sir.

76
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,055
Why the fuck did they deliver one of theirs?

77
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:28,299
Keep yourself at 20 meters, you may have explosives on.

78
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,397
- To the ground! Safety distances! - Anti-bomb protocol.

79
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:34,369
I repeat, anti-bomb protocol. It could be a trap.

80
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,041
To the ground! To the ground! Safety distance, possible explosion!

81
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,426
Get the suit off.

82
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:46,727
Listen, take off boots and overalls.

83
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,828
Remove boots and overalls!

84
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:00,900
Fast!

85
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:07,848
Take off your boots and your suit, fast!

86
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:49,850
T-shirt, raise your shirt!

87
00:06:57,225 --> 00:06:58,596
Ammanettatela.

88
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,489
On the ground, on your knees!

89
00:07:03,154 --> 00:07:04,531
Hands up.

90
00:07:12,184 --> 00:07:13,790
Raise those hands.

91
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,254
Do not shoot, I repeat, do not shoot.

92
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,726
That nobody touches that woman, I want her alive.

93
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:39,607
Tokyo.

94
00:07:44,474 --> 00:07:45,474
Tokyo!

95
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,497
Stop.

96
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:56,016
Stop!

97
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:02,535
Fuck.

98
00:08:10,342 --> 00:08:14,311
There are three types of risks: Killing you, hurting you ...

99
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:17,763
or who will take you. Today we will talk about the third.

100
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:19,255
Tokio?

101
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:22,067
Do you have any idea what to do if they catch you?

102
00:08:22,948 --> 00:08:24,195
A kick to the balls?

103
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:28,384
You must always ...

104
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:32,124
keep in mind the leitmotiv of this shot ...

105
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:36,032
to take...

106
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:37,649
in time

107
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:41,921
Take time.

108
00:08:41,948 --> 00:08:43,649
In reality...

109
00:08:43,677 --> 00:08:46,472
you must exploit all the possibilities you have to succeed.

110
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:05,454
The stomach.

111
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:07,202
- Here we go. - I can not breathe.

112
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,687
You broke something, fuck me.

113
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:14,274
Sir, the inmate says she feels a strong pain.

114
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,528
He says he can not breathe. I request medical assistance.

115
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,542
Okay, have it checked by a doctor.

116
00:09:20,564 --> 00:09:21,866
Got it.

117
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:23,380
Come on.

118
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,225
- It hurts. - Careful.

119
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:36,327
It hurts, it hurts so much.

120
00:09:36,438 --> 00:09:38,779
- A little further back. Back. - Fuck.

121
00:09:52,348 --> 00:09:53,736
You lied to us.

122
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:13,382
Did you say "no personal relationships" and Berlin is calling you by name?

123
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:16,218
Sergio?

124
00:10:17,564 --> 00:10:19,406
Why is that what you call, right?

125
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:23,231
Tokyo, maybe tomorrow, with a fresh mind, we'll see things ...

126
00:10:23,232 --> 00:10:24,995
Tomorrow I will not see anything.

127
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:27,820
I accepted to participate because I trusted you ...

128
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:30,746
because you would have been our guardian angel.

129
00:10:32,237 --> 00:10:33,953
Guardian angels do not lie.

130
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:00,966
My name is Sergio.

131
00:11:04,225 --> 00:11:05,691
Sergio Marquina.

132
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,212
My father was a robber.

133
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:16,255
They killed him during a shootout ...

134
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:18,770
with the police, at the entrance of a bank, it had been him ...

135
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:21,399
to design the shot.

136
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:25,056
Tokyo, between ...

137
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:28,286
among all those in the band, you're the one with the warmest head.

138
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:32,529
The time will come when you will think that everything is about to collapse.

139
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:36,002
That everything is going wrong.

140
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:39,200
That you are completely alone.

141
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:42,751
But I promise you it will not go that way.

142
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:47,404
I thought of everything.

143
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:54,310
And then, I'm a lucky man.

144
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:57,658
Are you a lucky guy?

145
00:11:59,146 --> 00:12:00,733
Tokyo, I will not abandon you.

146
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:04,561
You must never forget it.

147
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:14,779
The worst things that can happen to you when you're in charge of a robbery are: First:

148
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:17,760
to be arrested for assaulting the inspector's ex in charge.

149
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:19,471
Take the fingerprints and put it inside.

150
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,405
Second: they ask you for the identity card ...

151
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:23,781
- Documents. - And you can not give it a fake one.

152
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:28,396
Third: they take your fingerprints.

153
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:31,302
And if more than coincide with those found in a steering wheel ...

154
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:32,920
on which they are investigating ...

155
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,049
- even worse. - Empty the pockets in that pan.

156
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,108
Fourth: take your belongings ...

157
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:39,055
especially if you have the keys to the hangar ...

158
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:42,356
in which there are the control center and the exit of the escape route of the thieves ...

159
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:43,908
and a bottle of poison.

160
00:12:44,037 --> 00:12:46,826
It is a medicine for a heart condition ...

161
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:48,195
it's called Digoxina.

162
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:51,447
With which a few hours before you wanted to kill the mother of the inspector.

163
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:54,344
Follow me.

164
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:03,756
Stay here waiting to be heard.

165
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:17,207
Rafa.

166
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:27,306
From the mint: A few minutes ago the kidnappers have literally thrown out ...

167
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,733
using a stretcher, a person bound and gagged ...

168
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:33,995
which was recovered by the agents of the special intervention team.

169
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,821
This is Silene Oliveira, one of the kidnappers inside the Mint ...

170
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,276
{\ an8} LAST IMAGES LIVE FROM THE STATE OF THE STATE

171
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,059
{\ an8} LAST IMAGES LIVE FROM THE STATE OF THE STATE

172
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:43,935
and who is currently undergoing a medical examination ...

173
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:46,359
in the infirmary of the security zone.

174
00:13:46,972 --> 00:13:49,891
Fifth: that your accomplices lose their reason.

175
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:54,765


176
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,766
La casa de papel - 1x11 The cabeza of the plan

177
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:03,504


178
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:07,139


179
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:49,706


180
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,928
MONDAY, HOURS 19

181
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,320
81 HOURS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE RAPINA

182
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,652
Tokyo lost his mind.

183
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:32,277
He did not resist.

184
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,733
It was not easy.

185
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:44,138
But I had no choice but to deliver it.

186
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:52,413
Take hands.

187
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,740
I beg you...

188
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:00,174
we are here risking our lives ...

189
00:16:02,206 --> 00:16:04,960
it does not cost so much to take each other's hands.

190
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:09,979
When you open a wound ...

191
00:16:10,922 --> 00:16:12,621
the plates are compacted ...

192
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:13,775
to close it.

193
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:17,446
If they do not, the body inevitably dies.

194
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:22,412
A wound has opened and we must compact ourselves.

195
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:25,079
- Why the hell do you talk about platelets? - Rio.

196
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,191
What would you be?

197
00:16:26,364 --> 00:16:27,476
A preacher?

198
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:29,253
The leader of a sect?

199
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:32,809
Will you ascend in space with him holding hands?

200
00:16:32,903 --> 00:16:36,267
- Rio, you have to calm down. Immediately. - No. No, I do not calm down.

201
00:16:36,715 --> 00:16:38,380
You sent Tokio to jail.

202
00:16:39,844 --> 00:16:42,928
Do not you dare ask me to calm down, fuck ...

203
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:44,324
She's my girlfriend.

204
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:45,818
Girlfriend.

205
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,546
And you ruined her life.

206
00:16:49,453 --> 00:16:50,952
It's your first love.

207
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,678
It's the end of summer and you have to say goodbye to Susan on the French Riviera ...

208
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,739
- It seems the end of the world, but it is not. - Close that fucking mouth,

209
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,658
psychopath of shit ...

210
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:03,809
that you do not have a fucking idea of ​​what you say, clear?

211
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,689
Is there anyone who's not crazy, here?

212
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:10,827
Moscow.

213
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:14,399
Do you agree with the end of Tokyo?

214
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:15,729
Son ...

215
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,503
he lost his mind.

216
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,066
We have all seen it.

217
00:17:27,437 --> 00:17:28,437
Nairobi.

218
00:17:29,962 --> 00:17:31,858
We have rules ...

219
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:33,279
we voted ...

220
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,045
she did not accept it ...

221
00:17:35,046 --> 00:17:36,734
and then he was crazy.

222
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:40,999
Denver.

223
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:43,579
You realize how stupid she is, do not you?

224
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,965
Of course I understand that.

225
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:48,158
But he played Russian roulette with Berlin ...

226
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:49,812
how do you think?

227
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:53,970
- Nothing happened, fuck. - But there's not a hair.

228
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:56,145
Fuck.

229
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:58,559
little boy, open your eyes.

230
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:02,486
In Tokyo he gave her the brains and we can not keep a bomb.

231
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:03,881
Unbelievable ...

232
00:18:04,856 --> 00:18:06,274
you are all with Berlin ...

233
00:18:06,408 --> 00:18:09,900
- with a shit psychopath! - No, we're not all with Berlin ...

234
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:13,996
- we are all with the Professor. - With the Professor?

235
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,960
They arrested him.

236
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:19,712
We have all seen it on television.

237
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:21,380
He will not call ...

238
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:23,773
he will not wait for us at the exit of the tunnel.

239
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,662
Now you will say that there are two hours to the control call, right?

240
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,097
Wonderful.

241
00:18:34,554 --> 00:18:35,789
Because it's the last one.

242
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,808
Let's see what the hell you'll do when he does not call.

243
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:44,232
I do not intend to stay here to see it.

244
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:51,908
Some hostages have gone ...

245
00:18:52,574 --> 00:18:53,628
Tokio left ...

246
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,161
I guess it's not a problem if I leave too, right?

247
00:18:57,162 --> 00:18:58,829
You know it's not true, Rio.

248
00:19:00,513 --> 00:19:02,756
But it's your decision and we respect it. Come on.

249
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,809
Stay there.

250
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,537
Someone comes to close the front door, right?

251
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:16,618
Wait!

252
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,646
Just come out ...

253
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:23,023
take this and raise it ...

254
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:25,867
because they understand that you go out in peace.

255
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:29,408
There are shooters, I do not want anything to happen to you. Come on, take it.

256
00:19:30,578 --> 00:19:31,732
Hug me.

257
00:19:35,563 --> 00:19:36,848
I wish you the best.

258
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:40,485
Never stop believing in love ...

259
00:19:40,486 --> 00:19:41,608
it's important.

260
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:45,447
Trust me, trust me ...

261
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:46,628
trust me.

262
00:19:47,836 --> 00:19:50,788
You have to free your mind so you can think lucidly.

263
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,130
Trust me ...

264
00:19:52,453 --> 00:19:54,201
do it, let yourself go.

265
00:19:54,665 --> 00:19:56,594
Let yourself go, so ...

266
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:57,645
what's this.

267
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:00,174
A little 'rest and will come back to itself.

268
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,236
Killing Berlin.

269
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,082
Killing Berlin. Killing Berlin. Killing Berlin. Killing Berlin.

270
00:20:33,117 --> 00:20:36,499
Kill. Killing Berlin. Killing Berlin.

271
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,752
Killing Berlin.

272
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:39,056
Killing Berlin.

273
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:40,410
Killing Berlin.

274
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,071
This was the only phrase that resounded in my head ...

275
00:20:44,072 --> 00:20:45,284
but there was no way ...

276
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,507
as far as I thought ...

277
00:20:46,508 --> 00:20:49,285
I could not find a way to crush Berlin's life ...

278
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:51,479
without even going to Rio.

279
00:20:51,696 --> 00:20:53,517
I could reveal the escape plan ...

280
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:55,184
the position of the hangar ...

281
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:57,909
but a similar revenge would also be twisted against Rio ...

282
00:20:58,078 --> 00:20:59,336
my little Rio.

283
00:20:59,337 --> 00:21:02,960
And I remembered how much I had struggled for my love to be there.

284
00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:06,724
Well, I would say that today's lesson can end here.

285
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,484
What a hunger. You no?

286
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:16,695
Rio ...

287
00:21:18,331 --> 00:21:21,231
remember I told you we had to install a program?

288
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:22,730
Alone.

289
00:21:24,231 --> 00:21:25,587
The moment has come.

290
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,651
Fuck.

291
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,677
Nice single room, Professor ...

292
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:49,780
Is that where you bring the girls?

293
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,800
Let's get to work that there's a long way to go.

294
00:22:06,056 --> 00:22:08,273
Fuck, Professor, who made this mess?

295
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,251
A company.

296
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:13,081
Of course, a company, like no.

297
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,129
It looks like a cousin handyman job.

298
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,530
Okay, I did it with tutorials found on the internet.

299
00:22:18,781 --> 00:22:20,381
Beautiful shit tutorials.

300
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,980
That's why you are there, right?

301
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,500
There.

302
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,173
the voice editing program is ready.

303
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,582
To simply talk to the police ...

304
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,930
press MS. To contact the museum, zero.

305
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,450
That's all, the change of the voice ...

306
00:23:03,451 --> 00:23:05,629
the program does it directly when you speak.

307
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,030
- I can try it? - Self.

308
00:23:17,848 --> 00:23:19,349
<i> Talk to the robber. </ i>

309
00:23:22,229 --> 00:23:24,582
- Can you remove the woman's voice? - Sorry.

310
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,803
<I> Whore. Asshole. Frocio. </ I>

311
00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:34,003
Okay, I'll stop.

312
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,499
Try now.

313
00:23:41,661 --> 00:23:43,395
<i> Talk to the robber on the command ... </ i>

314
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:48,680
That's fine.

315
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:52,449
Now we have to log into the illegal internet network ...

316
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:55,529
- to buy illegal things. - In the deep web?

317
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,975
The submerged web.

318
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,181
Can you explain to me what we are doing?

319
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,982
I deactivated defenses and wi-fi and we connect via ethernet.

320
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:21,080
And I diverted the data traffic through a VPN via the Tor network.

321
00:24:21,281 --> 00:24:22,531
Sorry then...

322
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,351
CONTINUE

323
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:41,550
done!

324
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,679
There's everything, rifles, grenades, rocket launchers ...

325
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,850
it's like the USSR arsenal outlet. Look, a tank.

326
00:24:48,851 --> 00:24:51,252
We could enter the mint with a tank like the A-Team,

327
00:24:51,253 --> 00:24:53,852
- with the rifles, the plastic explosive. - Do you know what a Browning is?

328
00:24:53,853 --> 00:24:54,899
Yes, sure!

329
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,780
Well, we buy a Browning machine gun, assault rifles, guns and ammunition.

330
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,950
A V-750 missile, fuck! It's a cannonade.

331
00:25:02,951 --> 00:25:06,529
Imagine breaking into this with the tick, open the door and ... bam!

332
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,582
Missile V-750 aimed directly at the cops and ... boom!

333
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:14,031
Everyone fuck off. It would be great, fuck.

334
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,982
It's not expensive either, 60 bitcoins.

335
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:21,531
Equivalent plus or minus € 150,000.

336
00:25:22,582 --> 00:25:23,750
It's a good price.

337
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,871
Why did you exclude Rio from the plan?

338
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,751
So,

339
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,424
I do not owe you an explanation, but ...

340
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:49,099
I believe it is not ready.

341
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:51,115
You are wrong.

342
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:54,388
Are you sure?

343
00:25:54,781 --> 00:25:56,716
Work with him for months ...

344
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,481
you know him and you know he's deeply ...

345
00:26:00,482 --> 00:26:03,130
immature, it is not aware of what we are about to do.

346
00:26:03,131 --> 00:26:06,229
The bullets out there are real, there are no more lives like in video games.

347
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,399
- He knows what he does well. - Listen to me, responsibility is mine ...

348
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,076
I do not mean to involve a kid.

349
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:14,678
I'll give him a part for the trouble, but he's out of the plan.

350
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:17,423
Rio is the best in his field and you know it.

351
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,559
That's why you chose it.

352
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:21,486
It's a brains fucking ...

353
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,777
and you know that genes are weird.

354
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,678
Do you think you are an example of maturity?

355
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:29,434
- Tell me.

356
00:26:29,857 --> 00:26:31,507
Do you consider yourself a normal person?

357
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,236
Do you think it is normal to order shirts by color?

358
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:36,329
Did you see yourself?

359
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:38,014
Who buys your clothes?

360
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,717
Your aunt, Sister Gertrude?

361
00:26:45,408 --> 00:26:46,426
And those?

362
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:52,115
- What are? - Of origami ...

363
00:26:52,135 --> 00:26:55,129
- It's a millennial technique, please ... - What is it?

364
00:26:55,645 --> 00:26:58,322
Are you afraid that the paper dolls will break you?

365
00:26:59,381 --> 00:27:01,380
Welcome to Jurassic Park.

366
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,505
Help me, a dinosaur wants to eat me!

367
00:27:16,881 --> 00:27:18,161
What's the difference ...

368
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:19,822
between this ...

369
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,521
and play video games?

370
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:35,838
I'm sorry, but it's not a decision that's up to you to take.

371
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,851
If instead...

372
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,169
if Rio goes away, do not count on me.

373
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,043
Because I'm not mature enough either.

374
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,099
Well...

375
00:27:58,931 --> 00:28:01,917
maybe each of us is a little immature, in his own way.

376
00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:05,880
- And that makes us all a bit ... - Specials.

377
00:28:08,381 --> 00:28:09,556
.

378
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,365
And maybe it's not bad.

379
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,631
Maybe it's a virtue.

380
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:24,077
It is possible

381
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:26,847
Sure.

382
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:30,448
But do not tell me ...

383
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:34,081
tell him, he's behind the door.

384
00:28:41,831 --> 00:28:43,168
Thank you very much, Professor.

385
00:28:43,197 --> 00:28:44,753
You will not regret it, I promise you.

386
00:28:48,531 --> 00:28:49,551
Thank you.

387
00:28:55,957 --> 00:28:57,632
Are you the one who beats the cops?

388
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,622
Well, now I'll read the penal code.

389
00:29:03,682 --> 00:29:05,438
Article 33

390
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,732
offense of aggression to a public official.

391
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,987
Penis from one to four years of imprisonment.

392
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,330
And we will do our best to spend four years in a cool place.

393
00:29:14,347 --> 00:29:16,552
Could I please talk to my lawyer?

394
00:29:16,696 --> 00:29:17,735
Sure.

395
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,846
Speak to us as well.

396
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:20,088
You will need it.

397
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,330
I need the phone, the number is saved.

398
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:26,552
They took it with my personal belongings.

399
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,678
Wait here and do not move.

400
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:33,539
I'm sorry for the girl ...

401
00:29:33,768 --> 00:29:36,981
because among those bastards of the cops ...

402
00:29:37,581 --> 00:29:38,601
and they ...

403
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,374
I prefer the kidnappers.

404
00:29:41,187 --> 00:29:42,986
They made a bang.

405
00:29:43,037 --> 00:29:44,930
Well, let's see how it ends.

406
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,529
I tell you...

407
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:49,679
with all the riddled riders.

408
00:30:06,545 --> 00:30:07,565
Fuck.

409
00:30:10,113 --> 00:30:11,247
Sons of a bitch.

410
00:30:13,536 --> 00:30:15,251
Sons of a bitch. Fuck.

411
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:28,581
Look, look, Mr. Prieto.

412
00:30:28,981 --> 00:30:30,279
Miss Tokio.

413
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,276
Do you often interrogate women in underwear?

414
00:30:35,431 --> 00:30:36,933
Why did they deliver it?

415
00:30:38,023 --> 00:30:39,100
Well!

416
00:30:39,387 --> 00:30:40,712
Shit happens.

417
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:42,803
Why did they hunt her tied to a stretcher?

418
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:44,634
I had some fuss ...

419
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,048
with whom he commanded.

420
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,457
I tortured him for a while and did not take it very well.

421
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:50,501
Already.

422
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:53,339
You must know that your money will always be ...

423
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:54,433
Insured parties:

424
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:55,954
How I contacted you at the beginning ...

425
00:30:55,965 --> 00:30:58,998
I would also contact you once you got out of prison to give it to you.

426
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:01,189
Therefore the plan remains valid ...

427
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:03,221
because at worst,

428
00:31:03,877 --> 00:31:06,628
after a couple of years, you will have your money. And in the best ...

429
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:11,851
I'll try to get you out of jail when the waters ...

430
00:31:11,951 --> 00:31:15,212
- they will have calmed down. - That the plan is still valid means ...

431
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:16,894
that you do not have to talk to the police,

432
00:31:16,945 --> 00:31:18,356
nor with the judge ...

433
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,449
- nor with other prisoners, no? - Exactly.

434
00:31:21,478 --> 00:31:24,581
I'd rather bite my tongue, chew it and swallow it,

435
00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:25,851
rather than talking.

436
00:31:27,922 --> 00:31:29,966
Well, I'd say it's a method ...

437
00:31:30,026 --> 00:31:34,490
effective, a bit extreme, but effective. I wanted to offer you something a little more ...

438
00:31:35,757 --> 00:31:36,883
Fair]

439
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,507
An interrogation is like a game of skill,

440
00:31:39,571 --> 00:31:42,775
how to fly a kite. It can precipitate at any moment.

441
00:31:43,137 --> 00:31:44,604
With the right hand ...

442
00:31:45,378 --> 00:31:46,863
you leave little by little ...

443
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:48,695
Ed. Il Filo

444
00:31:49,228 --> 00:31:50,490
of truth.

445
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:54,136
How many people are you in there?

446
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,308
Eight.

447
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:01,103
The same eight who organized the shot,

448
00:32:01,126 --> 00:32:02,412
in a village near Toledo.

449
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:06,558
How long did it take you to prepare the shot in the village near Toledo?

450
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,347
Five months.

451
00:32:08,756 --> 00:32:11,308
When the kite stands out, when they will feel true ...

452
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,071
what you say, when ...

453
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,694
when they will be sure they can get information ...

454
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,634
with the left hand pull the thread

455
00:32:18,952 --> 00:32:20,414
and stop the kite.

456
00:32:21,672 --> 00:32:23,107
Take time.

457
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:25,664
Do you wear boxers, Colonel?

458
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:31,684
I always thought that the military liked wide underpants.

459
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:33,734
- Am I wrong? - Wide underpants!

460
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:41,582
Can anyone tell me why this woman is in these conditions?

461
00:32:45,828 --> 00:32:47,090
Excuse us.

462
00:32:51,465 --> 00:32:53,968
I'm happy to see you again, Miss Tokio.

463
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:58,657
This time we will be practical, I ask and she answers.

464
00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:01,638
Who is the Professor?

465
00:33:22,622 --> 00:33:24,006
- Ready? - Hello! I have to talk...

466
00:33:24,013 --> 00:33:26,386
with Inspector Raquel Murillo, please, it's urgent.

467
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:27,505
Who wants it?

468
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,730
<i> It's a personal matter. </ i>

469
00:33:31,984 --> 00:33:34,109
Inspector Murillo, urgent call.

470
00:33:36,286 --> 00:33:37,486
Answer as well.

471
00:33:37,876 --> 00:33:39,284
I do not move from here.

472
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:44,599
It is a personal matter.

473
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:48,820
- Who's talking? - Raquel, thank goodness! I'm...

474
00:33:49,021 --> 00:33:52,311
<i> I'm saving, I call you from the police station, they arrested me. </ i>

475
00:33:52,469 --> 00:33:54,675
<i> They accuse me of attacking ... </ i>

476
00:33:54,692 --> 00:33:56,953
a public official. Your husband, to be precise.

477
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:57,955
Don't ask why!

478
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,317
<i> I'm handcuffed and talk about ... </ i>

479
00:34:00,345 --> 00:34:02,102
four years imprisonment or worse.

480
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,649
In which police station are you?

481
00:34:04,713 --> 00:34:07,495
- In that of Canillas. - Do not worry.

482
00:34:07,591 --> 00:34:10,225
<i> - I'll be here as soon as possible. </ i> - Thanks.

483
00:34:21,913 --> 00:34:22,983
Let's continue.

484
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:25,430
I was about to talk about the Professor.

485
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:29,197
Her short hair, inspector, would be much better.

486
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:31,600
So he looks a little too maternal.

487
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:35,678
I'm really keen to tell you everything.

488
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:36,882
excellent

489
00:34:37,157 --> 00:34:40,440
Perfect, because I'm here with open arms waiting for him to do it.

490
00:34:40,895 --> 00:34:42,216
Look at the bright side...

491
00:34:42,344 --> 00:34:44,792
now you will not have to escape anymore.

492
00:34:45,536 --> 00:34:47,165
Now it's time to start from scratch.

493
00:34:49,585 --> 00:34:51,244
Do you want to know how everything started?

494
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:56,585
The professor picked me up.

495
00:34:58,547 --> 00:34:59,971
With a red Seat Ibiza.

496
00:35:01,342 --> 00:35:03,713
While the police were ambushing me.

497
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:08,124
No

498
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:11,692
No, no, it started all before.

499
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:16,813
A child.

500
00:35:19,137 --> 00:35:20,392
His name was Miguel.

501
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,184
He pulled my underwear down in front of the whole class.

502
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,034
Do you think I was expelled instead of that six-year-old little shit?

503
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:34,147
From that moment, everything went to hell.

504
00:35:58,737 --> 00:36:00,525
Is it true what they said before?

505
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:02,324
Did you tie a policeman?

506
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,024
You must say that there was a fight.

507
00:36:12,394 --> 00:36:14,105
If you hit it only you ...

508
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:16,287
you're in the shit.

509
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,556
I see you all too well, to be honest.

510
00:36:27,373 --> 00:36:29,232
Excuse me, can I go to the bathroom?

511
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:47,918
Keep an eye on it.

512
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:50,833
I did not come here to be a nurse.

513
00:36:51,754 --> 00:36:55,843
Neither to hear speeches nor to do shit therapies.

514
00:36:57,622 --> 00:37:01,801
First I had to shut up so as not to make the situation in the group worse.

515
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:03,089
It is a good thing...

516
00:37:04,551 --> 00:37:06,110
that you worry about your companions.

517
00:37:06,145 --> 00:37:07,933
Do you know what really worries me?

518
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:09,762
The Professor, Berlin ...

519
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:10,860
there is not!

520
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:12,825
There is only you.

521
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:14,560
And he is the brain.

522
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:17,603
Just because it's the brain organized ...

523
00:37:17,713 --> 00:37:20,442
a perfect plan that we will follow ...

524
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,239
step by step, without doing anything that he did not foresee.

525
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:25,055
You've already done something unexpected,

526
00:37:25,073 --> 00:37:26,351
you sent Tokyo.

527
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:29,746
Tokyo will have its part, if it behaves well ...

528
00:37:29,813 --> 00:37:30,997
and he says nothing.

529
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,150
Bullshits! His part would have obtained it in case of capture ...

530
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:37,935
not in case you throw it down the stairs straight up straight to the lions.

531
00:37:38,096 --> 00:37:41,443
With the shitty character he has, do you know what he's done? He will have told everything.

532
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,536
And the GEO will be in the hangar ...

533
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,725
to dig the tunnel on the other side to break in.

534
00:37:45,755 --> 00:37:48,583
You can put your complaints in the suggestion box,

535
00:37:48,778 --> 00:37:51,154
but unfortunately, as you could see with Rio,

536
00:37:51,317 --> 00:37:55,281
it will not do any good, because this is a patriarchy.

537
00:38:01,452 --> 00:38:04,791
- And what would you like to say? - It means that I command here!

538
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:11,032
And if you do not want to do the same thing ...

539
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:13,778
of Rio and Tokyo, I suggest you to have a camomile.

540
00:38:17,056 --> 00:38:18,766
What the fuck is he taking you, Nairobi?

541
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,168
Did you synchronize the cycle with Tokyo?

542
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:35,794
We are similar.

543
00:38:38,897 --> 00:38:41,626
I do not think my life is as exciting as yours.

544
00:38:42,968 --> 00:38:44,645
No, I do not believe it either.

545
00:38:46,696 --> 00:38:50,001
But it should not be easy to wear the skirt in the police body.

546
00:38:51,132 --> 00:38:53,125
And it's not even in a gang of robbers.

547
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,728
We are few.

548
00:38:57,758 --> 00:39:01,127
For this reason, we have to pull the balls out continuously.

549
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:03,818
Is it true?

550
00:39:05,695 --> 00:39:07,180
Does not it seem exhausting?

551
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:08,467
Silene ...

552
00:39:08,662 --> 00:39:10,858
I think you're wasting my time.

553
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:14,746
And you're playing any penalty reduction.

554
00:39:16,066 --> 00:39:17,428
Every minute that passes ...

555
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:18,627
It's a year more.

556
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:22,249
Listen ...

557
00:39:22,322 --> 00:39:24,070
you're young now.

558
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:26,326
He is hot. You do not miss anything.

559
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:30,531
In twelve years you will still be in shape.

560
00:39:30,903 --> 00:39:32,873
Maybe with some wrinkles, even interesting.

561
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:35,596
But if you will be released in 24 years ...

562
00:39:37,182 --> 00:39:39,573
you will have entered menopause.

563
00:39:39,857 --> 00:39:40,914
And that ...

564
00:39:41,198 --> 00:39:43,514
that's a different matter, is not it, Prieto?

565
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,857
I know because of his mother.

566
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:52,855
And I do not mean the hot flashes,

567
00:39:52,888 --> 00:39:54,456
but to the feeling ...

568
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:57,073
to have lost something important.

569
00:39:58,209 --> 00:40:00,123
Something intrinsically yours ...

570
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,313
that will have vanished forever.

571
00:40:03,926 --> 00:40:04,979
Your Life.

572
00:40:07,234 --> 00:40:08,532
Inspector.

573
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:14,443
Does he really see me in a park as a family mother?

574
00:40:14,854 --> 00:40:16,347
To change diapers?

575
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,091
But please.

576
00:40:20,562 --> 00:40:21,615
Listen

577
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:24,978
I give you the last chance before calling the investigating judge.

578
00:40:25,471 --> 00:40:27,001
If you do not speak, many greetings.

579
00:40:27,195 --> 00:40:29,217
Finish immediately for precautionary custody.

580
00:40:29,766 --> 00:40:32,109
And you will not have discounts for collaboration, repentance ...

581
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,224
and mitigating factors.

582
00:40:33,614 --> 00:40:36,780
And it would be 10-12 years of life.

583
00:40:37,845 --> 00:40:40,685
So think carefully before throwing everything in the wind.

584
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:44,260
Do you want a tip?

585
00:40:46,823 --> 00:40:47,823
Sure.

586
00:40:48,402 --> 00:40:49,980
Think of a nice place.

587
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:55,013
At a moment in life where you were really happy.

588
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:58,161
And breathe deeply.

589
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,980
Reflect.

590
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:16,299
Tokyo!

591
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,530
I can't take it anymore.

592
00:41:23,641 --> 00:41:24,914
You can not do it.

593
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:27,540
They drugged you like a horse.

594
00:41:28,471 --> 00:41:30,140
A hypnotic sedative.

595
00:41:31,734 --> 00:41:32,961
Get relaxed.

596
00:41:33,021 --> 00:41:34,143
And enjoy it.

597
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:39,813
Water 100

598
00:41:42,003 --> 00:41:43,117
Please.

599
00:41:54,234 --> 00:41:55,508
Go back to sleep.

600
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:57,471
How the fuck do I sleep?

601
00:41:57,701 --> 00:41:59,357
If I do not stop dreaming Tokyo.

602
00:41:59,556 --> 00:42:01,831
Tokyo is a daughter of a bitch.

603
00:42:02,373 --> 00:42:03,453
Don't ask why!

604
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:06,657
Do you know what your girlfriend did with the only hope of my life?

605
00:42:06,715 --> 00:42:09,570
When did he last see you? He was three years old, was not he?

606
00:42:09,571 --> 00:42:13,362
He put it in his mouth, he chewed it and spit it in my face.

607
00:42:13,717 --> 00:42:16,206
- He does not remember a shit about you. - Close that fucking mouth!

608
00:42:16,228 --> 00:42:18,720
- You do not remember, it will not recognize you. - Shut up.

609
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,456
But do you know what's the worst?

610
00:42:27,182 --> 00:42:28,540
It is that he is right.

611
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,831
He is right.

612
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,798
I would have kidnapped a child ...

613
00:42:36,897 --> 00:42:38,883
who has no idea who I am.

614
00:42:42,481 --> 00:42:44,255
I would have kidnapped a child ...

615
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:46,825
who has no idea who I am.

616
00:42:52,981 --> 00:42:55,478
And now I have no idea what to do with all that money.

617
00:43:00,189 --> 00:43:01,207
Listen.

618
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:02,955
Maybe not now ...

619
00:43:03,023 --> 00:43:06,333
but in a few years you can look for it and ...

620
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:09,237
and you can explain everything to him.

621
00:43:11,874 --> 00:43:13,226
You say to him: "Listen, fuck ...

622
00:43:13,563 --> 00:43:14,811
I'm your mother. "

623
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,930
"I am richly broken and I live in Jamaica."

624
00:43:19,045 --> 00:43:22,702
"If you want to know the full story, I'll buy you an airplane and come to meet me."

625
00:43:24,388 --> 00:43:26,020
And then, you're young.

626
00:43:26,784 --> 00:43:28,268
You have two ovaries, right?

627
00:43:28,948 --> 00:43:30,218
You can do another one.

628
00:43:32,482 --> 00:43:33,482
Already.

629
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:48,964
Five minutes, no more.

630
00:44:54,981 --> 00:44:56,227
Easy, no?

631
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:58,321
Listen.

632
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:03,003
Would you give me a child? Would you give it to me?

633
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,164
Sure.

634
00:45:05,721 --> 00:45:07,875
How do you want it, blond or dark?

635
00:45:08,898 --> 00:45:10,257
No kidding.

636
00:45:11,429 --> 00:45:14,001
If I go out of here, I need to have a reason ...

637
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,168
to live.

638
00:45:16,788 --> 00:45:17,832
Listen ...

639
00:45:17,914 --> 00:45:19,476
What can I tell you, Nairobi?

640
00:45:19,477 --> 00:45:22,151
Make a child to have a reason to live ...

641
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,141
It does not seem like a good plan.

642
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:25,350
No

643
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,743
- And then, I'm with Tokyo, not ... - I'm not asking you to marry me.

644
00:45:30,098 --> 00:45:31,900
I'm just asking you a little ...

645
00:45:31,901 --> 00:45:33,260
of sperm.

646
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:36,380
Two spintarelle and it's done, impregnated.

647
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:40,400
Because you are so attractive and intelligent ...

648
00:45:40,401 --> 00:45:42,660
and with that beautiful smile you have ...

649
00:45:42,742 --> 00:45:44,314
it would be so easy.

650
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,870
Stop! It's so easy!

651
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:49,567
If you lose a child, do another, do not you?

652
00:45:49,568 --> 00:45:52,220
Because in the end it only matters to have ...

653
00:45:52,221 --> 00:45:54,467
- a reason to live. - Fuck!

654
00:45:54,514 --> 00:45:57,581
Damn bitch, you say Tokio is crazy, but you're worse!

655
00:45:59,091 --> 00:46:00,594
- Where are you going? - To that country.

656
00:46:00,595 --> 00:46:01,997
No, no, stop.

657
00:46:03,029 --> 00:46:04,029
No

658
00:46:04,357 --> 00:46:07,257
We have to rub Berlin without having to deliver.

659
00:46:27,398 --> 00:46:28,498
Save

660
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:31,353
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

661
00:46:31,354 --> 00:46:33,016
I messed up everything, I'm very sorry.

662
00:46:33,017 --> 00:46:34,977
- What did that animal do to you? - No, no, no.

663
00:46:34,978 --> 00:46:37,010
It was not just his fault, I ...

664
00:46:38,561 --> 00:46:42,672
I talked about what he did to you, about the mistreatment of your sister.

665
00:46:43,071 --> 00:46:45,413
- Fuck. - I like it a lot. Really.

666
00:46:45,414 --> 00:46:47,625
I'm not so usually, I do not know what got me, but ...

667
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,593
the blood boiled.

668
00:46:49,594 --> 00:46:52,372
I'm not a violent, I've never beaten anyone.

669
00:46:52,373 --> 00:46:56,493
Never, I am one who solves things by speaking calmly.

670
00:46:56,494 --> 00:46:57,635
Did you defend yourself?

671
00:47:00,533 --> 00:47:03,776
Well, I'm not Mohamed Ali, but ...

672
00:47:05,081 --> 00:47:07,238
but I have my pride and ...

673
00:47:07,365 --> 00:47:09,700
I gave them to him. I played them ...

674
00:47:10,055 --> 00:47:11,203
for good.

675
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,028
But now I feel like a punching bag.

676
00:47:17,029 --> 00:47:19,145
- I think he won. - Let me see.

677
00:47:21,311 --> 00:47:22,346
Wait!

678
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:25,510
Fuck.

679
00:47:27,788 --> 00:47:30,433
I immediately call a doctor to let you visit, quiet.

680
00:47:31,131 --> 00:47:32,916
- I'll handle that. - Thank you.

681
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:42,072
I tell you that I'm attending one and two seconds time are you fighting?

682
00:47:42,721 --> 00:47:44,940
He hit me, I did not even touch him.

683
00:47:46,495 --> 00:47:48,596
- I want you to withdraw the complaint immediately. - Self?

684
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,589
Collect that against me.

685
00:47:51,492 --> 00:47:54,362
This story will help you a lot in the cause we have ...

686
00:47:54,389 --> 00:47:56,540
beating my partner, I mean.

687
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:59,492
That chuck of Chuck Norris wearing glasses made me lose consciousness.

688
00:47:59,499 --> 00:48:01,564
You can tell bullshit your lawyer.

689
00:48:01,637 --> 00:48:03,229
It will not help you with custody.

690
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,280
Raquel.

691
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,933
I did not do anything, I did not touch it.

692
00:48:06,934 --> 00:48:08,519
No? Come with me.

693
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,612
I'm Inspector Raquel Murillo, from the plant.

694
00:48:14,523 --> 00:48:18,142
I want to know who drafted the report against this man.

695
00:48:18,143 --> 00:48:21,959
And because he did not visit a doctor since he was beaten by this agent.

696
00:48:23,443 --> 00:48:24,443
Save

697
00:48:25,101 --> 00:48:26,453
open your shirt.

698
00:48:48,662 --> 00:48:51,321
This man would like to complain about abuse of power ...

699
00:48:51,322 --> 00:48:53,187
and you need to prepare a medical report.

700
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:55,753
You will all be witnesses in the report.

701
00:48:55,775 --> 00:48:59,223
Raquel, I do not know how fucking she's done, but I swear I did not touch her.

702
00:48:59,454 --> 00:49:03,210
The victim has bruises on the chest, ribs and abdomen.

703
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:05,754
He was clearly beaten up.

704
00:49:06,942 --> 00:49:09,162
Someone is writing the report, yes or no?

705
00:49:09,163 --> 00:49:10,163
Raquel.

706
00:49:10,809 --> 00:49:11,983
Agree.

707
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:14,800
Leave it.

708
00:49:14,908 --> 00:49:16,206
Withdraw the complaint.

709
00:49:16,407 --> 00:49:17,462
very good

710
00:49:17,463 --> 00:49:19,500
Then he will withdraw his.

711
00:49:19,616 --> 00:49:21,269
Remove the cuffs.

712
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:27,160
Where are your personal effects?

713
00:49:27,343 --> 00:49:30,911
Raquel, I would not look like a paranoid conspiracy theorist, but there are ...

714
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:33,156
my prints and my data around, do not ...

715
00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:34,789
Right.

716
00:49:35,279 --> 00:49:37,582
Where's the record of his arrest?

717
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:02,070
Let's go, save.

718
00:50:13,973 --> 00:50:15,891
I had never felt so lost.

719
00:50:19,105 --> 00:50:20,430
I had nothing left.

720
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,110
I just had to decide whether to betray my companions ...

721
00:50:28,894 --> 00:50:31,374
hoping for the clemency of the judge as a collaborator.

722
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:32,647
Do you want to say something?

723
00:50:50,508 --> 00:50:53,230
Someone could fry an egg, please?

724
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:55,254
Fuck.

725
00:50:55,275 --> 00:50:57,081
I've been eating craps for four days.

726
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:08,230
Tokyo, I will not abandon you, I have thought of everything.

727
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,443
And then, I'm a lucky man.

728
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,830
You must never forget it.

729
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,150
Tokyo, I will not abandon you.

730
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,525
I can not handle it anymore.

731
00:51:22,064 --> 00:51:24,570
It is the thirtieth chest like this.

732
00:51:25,479 --> 00:51:27,993
He does not care if he has a gunshot wound.

733
00:51:30,152 --> 00:51:34,330
I do not even want to think about the repercussions we will have, especially psychological ones.

734
00:51:35,698 --> 00:51:37,831
Having to come and work here every day.

735
00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:40,399
Having to relive it continuously.

736
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,830
Well, it will be difficult for everyone.

737
00:51:43,354 --> 00:51:47,547
And it is possible that some of us will suffer from post-traumatic stress.

738
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,790
Well, I have all the right credentials.

739
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:53,270
I do not know what is more traumatic than losing everything.

740
00:51:54,866 --> 00:51:56,237
I lost everything ...

741
00:51:56,438 --> 00:51:58,261
and these do not compensate.

742
00:51:58,450 --> 00:51:59,734
Quite the contrary.

743
00:51:59,835 --> 00:52:01,762
About one million euros ...

744
00:52:02,867 --> 00:52:04,044
it makes me laugh.

745
00:52:04,195 --> 00:52:06,148
You trust all of those who keep us locked up ...

746
00:52:06,149 --> 00:52:08,603
- as if we were beasts. - Do you finish it?

747
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:15,430
- Sorry? - Close that fucking mouth.

748
00:52:15,617 --> 00:52:17,235
Please, Alison.

749
00:52:17,236 --> 00:52:20,167
I'm sick of listening to this here that complains.

750
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,419
If you do not like it, do something, do not you?

751
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,578
Even I was complaining about everything.

752
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,570
Of my parents...

753
00:52:33,438 --> 00:52:35,359
of the school where I was bulled.

754
00:52:36,076 --> 00:52:37,870
I swallowed one toad after another.

755
00:52:39,206 --> 00:52:40,306
- Enough!

756
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,152
Honey, it's normal to see everything black right now.

757
00:52:43,165 --> 00:52:44,361
8 - Unlike many smartphones

758
00:52:46,108 --> 00:52:47,990
It will have ruined your life ...

759
00:52:49,821 --> 00:52:51,319
but he opened my eyes.

760
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:53,823
I realized that we are what we eat.

761
00:52:53,824 --> 00:52:57,010
And I do not know about you, but I've had enough of eating shit.

762
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,006
So I'm leaving.

763
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:01,122
Alison, do not talk nonsense.

764
00:53:01,123 --> 00:53:04,560
I am your guardian and responsible for your safety, so as long as you are ...

765
00:53:04,561 --> 00:53:06,262
She is here for the money.

766
00:53:06,945 --> 00:53:09,548
Your bribe may be good for you ...

767
00:53:09,549 --> 00:53:12,673
and being accomplices of these carrions. But not me.

768
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,255
And then it's not so difficult to get out of here.

769
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:19,639
Get out of here?

770
00:53:22,915 --> 00:53:24,015
How?

771
00:53:24,672 --> 00:53:26,212
I just need to hurt myself.

772
00:53:27,966 --> 00:53:29,478
They will take me to another place ...

773
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:30,939
and from there I can escape.

774
00:53:31,086 --> 00:53:34,423
No, no and no. Do not even think about doing such stupid things.

775
00:53:34,517 --> 00:53:36,039
Mercedes, Mercedes ...

776
00:53:36,628 --> 00:53:38,274
let the girl explain herself.

777
00:53:39,726 --> 00:53:42,590
I've seen it more than ten times since we've been here.

778
00:53:43,623 --> 00:53:47,122
Press the button and the door only takes four seconds to open.

779
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:49,115
Four seconds and run out ...

780
00:53:49,466 --> 00:53:51,270
you do not need anything else.

781
00:53:52,157 --> 00:53:55,354
Four seconds are enough and they move forward to shoot you.

782
00:53:56,635 --> 00:53:58,064
We'll see.

783
00:54:30,589 --> 00:54:31,946
How are you, hostages?

784
00:54:32,147 --> 00:54:35,030
The million euro makes you sleep peacefully?

785
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:38,353
So keep on dreaming ...

786
00:54:38,695 --> 00:54:40,171
because no one will give it to you.

787
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,082
It's a lie...

788
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,475
as well as that your companions have been freed ...

789
00:54:45,494 --> 00:54:47,983
those who chose to leave instead of a million, no.

790
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:50,542
Two floors are underneath you.

791
00:54:50,543 --> 00:54:53,770
- What a fool. - Chained to the pipes.

792
00:54:53,972 --> 00:54:55,613
It was a strategy ...

793
00:54:55,653 --> 00:54:59,392
to make you stay calm like sheep while you work for us.

794
00:54:59,434 --> 00:55:01,347
But with a smile on your lips ...

795
00:55:01,348 --> 00:55:04,799
because here we must always be smiling!

796
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,830
True or not, Mr. Andrés de Fonollosa ...

797
00:55:07,865 --> 00:55:09,870
that we do not want long faces?

798
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,868
Are you done?

799
00:55:12,869 --> 00:55:16,473
We will not get out of the hole you are digging, no ...

800
00:55:16,474 --> 00:55:20,320
we will go out of one who comes directly into the safe.

801
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:29,170
You are guilty of high treason, Rio.

802
00:55:29,902 --> 00:55:31,241
It is unforgivable.

803
00:55:31,765 --> 00:55:33,585
- Here we go. - Come on, let's go.

804
00:55:48,501 --> 00:55:49,750
Are there any news?

805
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,862
No, he did not say anything.

806
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,896
Apparently, Miss Tokio does not intend to cooperate.

807
00:55:57,352 --> 00:55:58,487
Colonel ...

808
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:00,411
a question.

809
00:56:01,236 --> 00:56:05,094
The deputy inspector Rubio told her something about a teaspoon?

810
00:56:05,302 --> 00:56:06,578
A teaspoon?

811
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:07,839
No because?

812
00:56:07,891 --> 00:56:10,798
Ángel had it analyzed before having the accident ...

813
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:13,157
the fingerprints coincide with those of the subject ...

814
00:56:13,158 --> 00:56:15,830
that forced the steering wheel to threaten the Russian.

815
00:56:16,091 --> 00:56:18,288
It is the same person who helps them from the outside.

816
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,980
- And who the hell is he? - I do not know.

817
00:56:21,683 --> 00:56:25,145
I will be the same person who tampered with Ángel's car and caused the accident.

818
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,808
But only Ángel knows this.

819
00:56:27,124 --> 00:56:28,252
And she.

820
00:56:41,843 --> 00:56:43,273
Tell me something.

821
00:56:45,913 --> 00:56:47,880
Stay silent for everyone ...

822
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:50,544
or just for Aníbal Cortés?

823
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:56,110
You see that you are in love, in this picture.

824
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,847
How about if I offer you two for one?

825
00:57:05,345 --> 00:57:06,555
Is there a happy hour?

826
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:09,090
I offer him the same agreement that I offer to you.

827
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:12,150
Mitigation, repentance and collaboration.

828
00:57:13,088 --> 00:57:16,750
Provided that the information you give us will serve to put an end word ...

829
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:17,936
to this nightmare.

830
00:57:17,989 --> 00:57:20,178
We are talking about a third of the sentence.

831
00:57:21,707 --> 00:57:22,968
It's impossible...

832
00:57:23,288 --> 00:57:25,987
we have so many crimes that we can spend more lives in prison ...

833
00:57:26,022 --> 00:57:28,051
no judge can promise us so much.

834
00:57:30,106 --> 00:57:31,168
Even less her.

835
00:57:32,636 --> 00:57:35,560
Look, I do not know what they told you but if you regret ...

836
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:39,240
collaborate and help save the lives of fifty victims ...

837
00:57:39,274 --> 00:57:41,760
I assure you that any judge will be kind.

838
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:44,186
Aníbal Cortés is not guilty of personal injury.

839
00:57:44,358 --> 00:57:47,042
- In five years it would be out. - At 24,

840
00:57:47,078 --> 00:57:48,980
as if he had just graduated.

841
00:57:49,209 --> 00:57:51,483
I think it's a better plan than doing the end ...

842
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:52,996
about your last boyfriend ...

843
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:54,626
do not you think?

844
00:58:05,283 --> 00:58:07,730
It was a very bad idea to talk to the hostages, Rio.

845
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:11,188
You can even throw me out like Tokyo.

846
00:58:11,938 --> 00:58:12,941
Tied up for good.

847
00:58:12,964 --> 00:58:15,629
- Because I'm not going to shut up. - I trust in Tokyo ...

848
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:18,868
but you are a brat.

849
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:22,426
What a pity. He thinks that paradox, Helsinki.

850
00:58:23,717 --> 00:58:24,717
Tokyo ...

851
00:58:25,219 --> 00:58:27,795
he'll shut up to protect him.

852
00:58:29,604 --> 00:58:33,666
And yet, you will disappear without her knowing it.

853
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,109
What will you do to me?

854
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:37,455
What you begged me to do.

855
00:58:41,302 --> 00:58:42,537
Execute you.

856
00:58:43,702 --> 00:58:45,960
In fact, you've lost your mind.

857
00:58:46,208 --> 00:58:48,201
I can not allow you to leave ...

858
00:58:48,693 --> 00:58:50,359
but neither do you remain

859
00:58:50,376 --> 00:58:56,376
What you said to the hostages was your sentence and I will not shake my hand.

860
00:59:06,002 --> 00:59:08,159
Well, actually it trembles a little.

861
00:59:14,648 --> 00:59:16,255
That's right.

862
00:59:16,321 --> 00:59:19,863
It is important to face death with spirit.

863
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:25,896
Who, like me, acts in an inconsiderate way ...

864
00:59:26,258 --> 00:59:28,376
it's not that he cares about the consequences ...

865
00:59:28,678 --> 00:59:29,678
No

866
00:59:29,837 --> 00:59:31,767
he cares like anyone else.

867
00:59:32,997 --> 00:59:35,739
It's just that we only get aware of it when it's too late.

868
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:40,257
We only become aware of it when we face it.

869
00:59:43,383 --> 00:59:45,369
Do you want to say your last words?

870
00:59:46,295 --> 00:59:49,477
You can still learn from your mistakes and stop being an asshole.

871
00:59:49,943 --> 00:59:51,701
Mamma mia, Helsinki!

872
00:59:51,811 --> 00:59:54,240
This boy just became a man.

873
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:58,632
If you had not died so early, you could have been a new Paulo Coelho.

874
01:00:00,043 --> 01:00:01,065
What a pity...

875
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:04,081
- the world will have to do without it. - Berlin!

876
01:00:04,897 --> 01:00:06,570
What the fuck are you doing?

877
01:00:06,595 --> 01:00:07,990
Lower the gun.

878
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:10,049
Discussion time is over.

879
01:00:10,097 --> 01:00:14,157
Unfortunately, democracy only gave us problems and I just issued the sentence.

880
01:00:14,176 --> 01:00:16,717
Enough bullshit, we have all the nerves on edge.

881
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,837
Berlin, we do not make things worse.

882
01:00:46,873 --> 01:00:47,873
Berlin...

883
01:00:48,069 --> 01:00:49,951
we can not make war between us.

884
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:53,821
Turn it down.

885
01:00:55,106 --> 01:00:56,106
Berlin.

886
01:01:06,953 --> 01:01:10,758
See to lower that gun or you'll see the green mice in pain ...

887
01:01:10,825 --> 01:01:13,320
I found your painkillers.

888
01:01:21,999 --> 01:01:23,031
What are you going to do...

889
01:01:23,049 --> 01:01:26,175
Nairobi? Break the vials one by one like Tokyo did?

890
01:01:26,206 --> 01:01:28,840
Well, you know what it is, I have the cycle.

891
01:01:29,223 --> 01:01:32,909
But how we are gossip, we women, is not it?

892
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:36,030
And how we get angry if one passes where we have washed.

893
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:55,936
Son of a bitch!

894
01:02:04,836 --> 01:02:07,520
Berlin, you have a lost call, honey.

895
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:10,386
Come on, stop.

896
01:02:11,236 --> 01:02:12,236
That's enough.

897
01:02:14,708 --> 01:02:15,712
very good

898
01:02:16,042 --> 01:02:17,117
you chose.

899
01:02:17,157 --> 01:02:18,897
Bad, but you chose.

900
01:02:19,082 --> 01:02:20,157
Take it away.

901
01:02:20,804 --> 01:02:22,716
And at that moment I saw myself clearly ...

902
01:02:22,961 --> 01:02:24,038
in court...

903
01:02:24,151 --> 01:02:25,292
in jail.

904
01:02:25,439 --> 01:02:27,526
And I understood that the inspector was right ...

905
01:02:27,982 --> 01:02:31,240
that it was not worth sacrificing for a failed plan ...

906
01:02:31,966 --> 01:02:33,480
for the Professor's plan.

907
01:02:33,655 --> 01:02:36,042
Especially because I thought he had deceived me.

908
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:37,954
Sergio!

909
01:02:39,852 --> 01:02:41,045
His name is Sergio.

910
01:02:41,154 --> 01:02:42,168
One moment.

911
01:02:43,332 --> 01:02:44,472
Let her talk.

912
01:02:47,547 --> 01:02:49,478
The Professor is called Sergio Marquina.

913
01:02:49,782 --> 01:02:51,543
And the shot is an idea of ​​his father.

914
01:02:56,222 --> 01:02:58,027
And the person who helps you from the outside, who is he?

915
01:02:59,741 --> 01:03:00,774
Inspector ...

916
01:03:01,705 --> 01:03:03,526
they are calling from the tick.

917
01:03:11,756 --> 01:03:13,895
How are you, how was your day?

918
01:03:13,934 --> 01:03:15,473
<i> Well, I would say well. </ i>

919
01:03:16,075 --> 01:03:18,649
To tell the truth, I was a little worried about her.

920
01:03:19,365 --> 01:03:21,407
<i> I thought we would not talk ... </ i>

921
01:03:21,408 --> 01:03:24,200
<i> that something irreparable had happened to her. </ i>

922
01:03:24,631 --> 01:03:25,731
<I> Sergio. </ I>

923
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:33,513
<i> It's kind of worrying, inspector, but ... </ i>

924
01:03:35,547 --> 01:03:37,921
I am a lucky man, he must never forget it.

925
01:03:39,638 --> 01:03:41,439
<i> I simply called her to say hello ... </ i>

926
01:03:41,497 --> 01:03:44,480
<i> I leave her to question Tokio, she has many things to tell her. </ i>

927
01:03:44,517 --> 01:03:45,892
And as soon as it's finished ...

928
01:03:46,659 --> 01:03:47,683
call me.

929
01:03:49,347 --> 01:03:51,112
That from here I do not move.

930
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:05,144
What do you have to tell me?

931
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:07,727
They kicked me to give you a message in person.

932
01:04:08,663 --> 01:04:11,834
Inside, we have a hydrogen bomb of seventeen megatons.

933
01:04:13,372 --> 01:04:15,870
We'll blow it out tomorrow at twelve.

934
01:04:17,132 --> 01:04:18,844
I'd like to talk to a priest.

935
01:04:20,073 --> 01:04:21,383
I must confess.

936
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:23,674
excellent

937
01:04:24,025 --> 01:04:27,310
we will propose detention in isolation, without bail

938
01:04:28,247 --> 01:04:29,247
Gómez ...

939
01:04:29,462 --> 01:04:33,301
draft the report and underline the lack of collaboration and repentance.

940
01:04:33,604 --> 01:04:35,510
Have it lead to the nearest prison.

941
01:04:35,542 --> 01:04:36,785
Lobo, take it away.

942
01:04:52,363 --> 01:04:55,464
- Control call. - Here, everything is as smooth as oil.

943
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:56,637
<i> Like oil? </ i>

944
01:04:57,704 --> 01:05:00,658
Like oil, do you mean Tokyo interrogated by the police?

945
01:05:01,262 --> 01:05:04,454
Like oil, do you mean that Rio did not do justice to you?

946
01:05:04,506 --> 01:05:06,240
<i> Berlin, what are you doing? </ i>

947
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:13,444
Professor, I'm Nairobi.

948
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:15,275
Berlin is not doing very well ...

949
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:18,210
so, starting now, I'm in charge.

950
01:05:20,804 --> 01:05:23,920
The matriarchy begins.

951
01:05:30,418 --> 01:05:32,604
<i> In the next episode ... </ i>

952
01:05:43,021 --> 01:05:45,093
We have to do something, steal a weapon from him.

953
01:05:45,094 --> 01:05:49,520
- Where do we find a gun? - Replacing it with a false one.

954
01:05:51,044 --> 01:05:56,360
Your accomplice Silene Oliveira from tonight will be in custody without bail.

955
01:05:57,833 --> 01:06:01,614
- Nairobi is now in charge. - You decide, you're with me ...

956
01:06:02,031 --> 01:06:03,345
or against me?

957
01:06:05,613 --> 01:06:07,344
I will release eleven hostages ...

958
01:06:07,475 --> 01:06:11,638
I want a journalist and a cameraman to cover the news from inside.

959
01:06:16,248 --> 01:06:17,248
Let's leave.

960
01:06:17,313 --> 01:06:20,240
I close the cider in a couple of days ...

961
01:06:20,651 --> 01:06:22,880
and we leave together in a Caribbean country.

962
01:06:24,488 --> 01:06:26,144
I try to take the gun ...

963
01:06:26,223 --> 01:06:27,600
give me good luck.

964
01:06:34,255 --> 01:06:36,200
Let's move on to the Cameroon floor.

965
01:06:37,065 --> 01:06:39,965
<i> Deputy Inspector Rubio, will leave the coma. </ i>

966
01:06:40,007 --> 01:06:43,124
Go make sure it's not a trap. If it was not ...

967
01:06:43,173 --> 01:06:44,494
<i> you will have to delete it. </ i>

968
01:06:48,809 --> 01:06:50,055
We organize the operation ...

969
01:06:50,094 --> 01:06:53,381
but on the spot we will be there to take it with our hands in the bag.

970
01:06:54,052 --> 01:06:55,915
Let's go, fast.

971
01:06:55,957 --> 01:06:57,330
The hostages, fuck!

972
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:59,863
Do not open the door!

973
01:07:01,522 --> 01:07:04,746
